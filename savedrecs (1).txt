AB This paper introduces a diagnostic tool that can be used by fish processing companies to evaluate their own traceability systems in a systematic manner. The paper begins with discussions on the rationale of traceability systems in food manufacturing companies, followed by a detailed analysis of the most important indicators in the designing and executing traceability systems. The diagnostic tool is presented in four grids through which fish companies can evaluate their own developed traceability system. The paper argues that if a company operates at a higher level of contextual factors, then design and execution of traceability system needs to be at a higher level as well so as to achieve a higher level of traceability system performance. The paper concludes that companies that are able to systematically assess their own developed traceability systems are able to determine food safety problems well in advance, and thereby take appropriate corrective actions.

AB The Korean government tried to secure food safety by revitalization of seafood traceability system since there has been growing dissatisfaction toward of food system related to seafood in Korea. This study examines the consumers' perspective on seafood traceability system and the value of seafood traceability in Korea using contingent valuation method. The model includes preference and recognition of respondents for the seafood traceability system, and socio-demographic characteristics. The result of the model shows that respondents think positively about seafood traceability system and it is expected that approximately $44.94 million can be generated annually from the seafood traceability system. The result implies that it is necessary to promote the system in order to make this system known, the benefit of which is helpful in food safety.

ID SUPPLY CHAIN TRACEABILITY; FRAMEWORK; DESIGN; IMPLEMENTATION; MODEL;
   PERSPECTIVES; TECHNOLOGIES; METHODOLOGY; INTEGRATION; PRODUCTS
AB Background: Traceability of food products, ingredients and associated operations are important requirements for improving food safety and consumer confidence. Food traceability systems (FTSs) often suffer from inefficiency in either material or information flow within an enterprise or between supply chain partners. Modelling of system architecture is a visualisation approach that allows multiple parties to collaborate in a system design process, identify its inefficiencies and propose improvements. However, there is little academic research on the ability to use a standard visualisation tool that supports collaborative design and considers both material and information flow for a given food traceability system.
   Scope & approach: The aim of this research is to propose a new visualisation approach that allows supply chain operators to collaborate effectively in the design process of FTSs capable of maintaining streamlined information flow, minimising information loss, and improving supply chain performance.
   Key findings & conclusion: Food traceability systems are complex, encompassing processes, material flow, information flow, techniques, infrastructure, people and control strategies. Screening of literature demonstrates that model-based system engineering (MBSE) offers a sound way for visualisation of such complex systems. However, in the food traceability literature, an MBSE-based standardised traceability system modelling approach is absent. This study makes a strong contribution to existing literature by proposing a novel, material and information flow modelling technique (MIFMT), to visualise FTS architecture. MIFMT can support common understanding and iterative implementation of effective FTSs that contextualise food supply chains at multiple levels and provides opportunity to identify points at where inefficiencies can occur so that actions can be taken to mitigate them.

AB Processed food has become an indispensable part of the human food chain. It provides rich nutrition for human health and satisfies various other requirements for food consumption. However, establishing traceability systems for processed food faces a different set of challenges compared to primary agro-food, because of the variety of raw materials, batch mixing, and resource transformation. In this paper, progress in the traceability of processed food is reviewed. Based on an analysis of the food supply chain and processing stage, the problem of traceability in food processing results from the transformations that the resources go through. Methods to implement traceability in food processing, including physical separation in different lots, defining and associating batches, isotope analysis and DNA tracking, statistical data models, internal traceability system development, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain-based approaches are summarized. Traceability is evaluated based on recall effects, TRUs (traceable resource units), and comprehensive granularity. Different methods have different advantages and disadvantages. The combined application of different methods should consider the specific application scenarios in food processing to improve granularity. On the other hand, novel technologies, including batch mixing optimization with AI, quality forecasting with big data, and credible traceability with blockchain, are presented in the context of improving traceability performance in food processing.

AB Food traceability systems are an important means to provide food safety and quality information to consumers. We studied consumers' interest in the information provided through food traceability systems by examining a national representative sample of 6243 Japanese consumers through a 2006 online survey. The ratio of respondents who have accessed information through traceability systems is low. With respect to the 11 kinds of information we focused on in our study, respondents attached most importance to harvest date, production method, and production method certification. Our results show that more educated females have a stronger desire to access more specific information related to fresh produce, whereas less educated males are more likely to trace information through fresh produce traceability systems. We have outlined the implications of these findings. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Implementing vegetable traceability systems is complex. Farmers are producers and the first point of traceability. Their intention and behavior related to implementation of vegetable traceability systems directly determine the success or failure of the implementation of those systems. The objective of this study was to identify factors that affect participation behavior in vegetable traceability systems by using a structural equation model and a logistic regression model. Data collected from a 2019 in-person interview survey of vegetable farmers located in Jiangxi province, China were analyzed. Results from the structural equation model showed that perceived usefulness positively affected farmers' participation intentions and their participation intentions positively affected their participation behavior. The impacts of social influence on perceived usefulness were greater than the impacts of traceability system characteristics on perceived usefulness. Facilitating conditions such as equipment resources, knowledge, and skills that farmers have a significant positive impact on the perceived ease of use. Facilitating conditions and perceived usefulness were two key factors influencing participation intention. Results from the logistic regression model showed that gender, age, marital status, cooperative organization membership, and whether the respondents were near a city had a significant impact on participation intention. The conclusions of this study further expanded the current research scope regarding farmers' quality and safety behaviors and revealed the internal decision-making mechanism for farmers' participation behavior regarding vegetable traceability systems. This study has implications for implementing vegetable traceability systems to ensure food safety in China or elsewhere in the world.

AB The significant link between farms and supermarkets has a far-reaching influence on the circulation pattern and traceability of agricultural products and supermarket business structure. This article presents a new platform called the integrated wireless traceability terminal (WTT) solution for agricultural products traceability information collection and packaging procedure integration. It collects traceability data such as package weight, field number, and other origin information about the corresponding address of farm or company. Meanwhile, it will print a traceability label which is used by the consumer or administrators to query traceability information through the internet.
   A test evaluation of the WIT solution is performed during vegetable harvest time in a large organic agricultural products company. Compared to the current traditional packaging procedure, a statistical analysis shows that this solution not only decreases the packaging time (total time for packing a package) about 15%, but also reduces the total material cost by approximately 37%. In addition, the traceability content is more detailed and precise than traditional method. These results suggest that the WTT solution can be reliably used for packaging agricultural products and traceability information acquisition.

AB The increase of the awareness about the environmental, social, and legal issues associated with seafood and fish products led to significant concerns of the shareholders, and challenges to the corporate social responsibility initiatives of companies. Many countries have begun to implement a traceability system to increase vertical coordination and guarantee safety in fish products. This paper aims to provide information about the barriers that influence the implementation of the traceability system for the fish products in Romania. The research is based on the results of an empirical study on the barriers that influence Romanian fish farms to adopt the traceability system. The questioners applied in Romanian fish farms investigate barriers like the basic characteristics of the enterprises and whether they export, the costs of adoption, and different traceability standards in the markets, in order to provide the information necessary for the development of a traceability system which will satisfy the needs of all the stakeholders and will be adopted by the companies.

AB An effective and trustworthy traceability system is important for food safety and quality; however, traditional traceability systems that only rely on the recording method do not completely prevent food fraud. DNA-based traceability techniques facilitate seamless connectivity within the entire food supply chain. A convenient and low-cost ear tag device was invented for collecting animal blood samples as an identity control, and a panel including 12 single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) loci was selected to distinguish individuals with a matching probability of 1.70 x 10(-5). The exact animal individual was identified by comparing the SNP genotype barcodes between the meat and blood samples derived from the recording system to further validate authenticity of the recording system. These results illustrate that a combination of the genetic traceability method and a traditional recording system can provide trustworthy traceability for consumers.

AB The aim of a traceability system is to collect in a rigorous way all the information related to the displacement of the different products along the supply chain. This information proves essential when facing food safety crisis, and allows efficiently managing the consequent product recall action. Although a recall action could be absolutely critical for a company, both in terms of incurred costs and of media impact, at present most companies do not posses reliable methods to precisely estimate the amount of product that would be discarded in the case of recall.
   The skill of limiting the quantity of recalled products to the minimum can be assumed as a measure of the performance and of the efficiency of the traceability system adopted by the company. Motivated by this consideration, this paper introduces novel criteria and methodologies for measuring and optimizing the performance of a traceability system. As opposed to previous introduced methods, which optimize indirect measures, the proposed approach takes into direct account the worst-case (or the average) quantity of product that should be recalled in the case of a crisis. Numerical examples concerning the mixing of batches in a sausage production process are reported to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Beef has become a kind of important food in China because of its nutritional value perceived by consumers. With increasing consumes' awareness and governments' regulations on beef quality and safety, traceability is becoming a mandatory requirement in cattle/beef industry. This paper developed and evaluated a cattle/beef traceability system that integrated RFID technology with PDA and barcode printer. The system requirements, the business flow of the cattle/beef chain, and the key traceability information for the system were identified through a survey. Then a conceptual model was proposed to describe the process of traceability information acquisition, transformation and transmission along the supply chain. Finally, the system was evaluated and optimized in the sampled supply chain.
   The results show that the major benefits gained from the RFID-enabled traceability system are the real-time and accurate data acquisition and transmission, and the high efficiency of information tracking and tracing across the cattle/beef supply chain; the main barriers for implementing the system are the inapplicable method of inputting information, the inefficient sequence of data input and communication mechanism associated with RFID reader, and the high implementation cost.

AB The history of traceability reveals that nomadic herders as early as 1000 BCE marked livestock with irons and ear incisions in order to protect against thefts. Nowadays, we build traceability systems to document the origin of foods, and in order to ensure safer foods when tracking and recalling products. A holistic traceability system includes, as a minimum, identification elements, databases and an information flow. The animal identification elements refers to body marks, ear tags, Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, retina image recognition, or DNA fingerprinting. The product identification refers to barcodes (EAN UCC, PLU, and GS1), 2D barcodes (QR, VC, and DM) and RFID or Electronic Product Code (EPC). The present review describes existing and upcoming traceability technologies for farm animals and their products, to update the common methods for information collection and data inquiry, with the view to expound traceability policies and regulations between developed and developing countries. The benefits of the new technologies and their practical limitations are also discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In a traceability system, a large and dynamic group of participants must be identified. The identification of information to be recorded represents the most important requirement for developing an effective traceability system. The information identified during the transport and processing of vegetables is often lost and inaccurate. In this paper, a system approach is used in order to develop a methodology for the implementation of the vegetable supply chain traceability. First of all, the main discussed issues emerge at various abstraction levels throughout the elaboration of traceability systems. Secondly, a Unified Modeling Language model is introduced for traceability along with a set of suitable patterns. A series of Unified Modeling Language class diagrams is developed in order to conceive a method for modeling the product, process, and quality information in the vegetable supply chain. Then will be discussed the adequate technological standards for setting out, registering, as well as for enabling the business collaborations. Finally, a traceability system implementation will be shown through a case study on vegetable supply chains and a comparison with European Union's General Food Law. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Rice is an essential food commodity in national and food security in Indonesia with a complex supply chain network. Various risks related to food quality and food safety occurs along the supply chain. Therefore, a tool is needed to monitor the rice production process from upstream to downstream (land-to-table) by implementing a traceability system to promote food transparency. In this system, all actors must be responsible for ensuring the quality and safety of products through various handling processes carried out from cultivation to product distribution. This paper aimed to develop a smart IT (Information Technology)-based traceability system in the rice supply chain using the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The actors involved in the rice supply chain consist of farmers, processing industries, distributors, bulogs, and retailers. Furthermore, this paper discussed the system architecture and the development of traceability system design using a data flow diagram (DFD). The developed prototype system shows the functional requirements of the system and can be used by stakeholders to monitor the production process and assist the decision-making process.

AB Simple Summary Given the high economic and qualitative values of local-breed meat products, it is not uncommon that substitution or mislabeling (either fraudulent or accidental) occurs at the market level. Therefore, to protect the interests of both producers and consumers, a reliable traceability tool should be developed. Nowadays, traceability usually relies on physical labeling systems (e.g., ear tags, tattoos, or electronic transponders). These systems do not, however, have good performances when dealing with carcasses or processed meat products. Molecular markers (i.e., based on the DNA sequence) can be a solution, since DNA is easily extracted from a wide variety of animal products and parts, and is not degraded during processing, even at the high temperatures involved. The aim of this study was to identify a small number of DNA mutations for breed-traceability purposes, in particular of the Italian Nero Siciliano pig and its derived products. A small panel of 12 DNA mutations was enough to discriminate Nero Siciliano pigs from other pig breeds and from wild boars. Food authentication in local breeds has important implications from both an economic and a qualitative point of view. Meat products from autochthonous breeds are of premium value, but can easily incur fraudulent or accidental substitution or mislabeling. The aim of this study was to identify a small number of SNPs using the Illumina PorcineSNP60 BeadChip for breed traceability, in particular of the Italian Nero Siciliano pig and its derived products. A panel of 12 SNPs was sufficient to discriminate Nero Siciliano pig from cosmopolitan breeds and wild boars. After adding 8 SNPs, the final panel of 20 SNPs allowed us to discriminate all the breeds involved in the study, to correctly assign each individual to its breed, and, moreover, to discriminate Nero Siciliano from first-generation hybrids. Almost all livestock breeds are being genotyped with medium- or high-density SNP panels, providing a large amount of information for many applications. Here, we proposed a method to select a reduced SNP panel to be used for the traceability of pig breeds.

AB DNA analysis with molecular markers has opened a way to understand complex organism's genome. It is presently being widely applied across different fields, where food takes a preeminent position. Constant outbreaks of foodborne illnesses are increasing consumer's attention towards more detailed information related to what they are consuming. This overview reports on the areas where food traceability has been considered, and the problems that still remain to be bypassed in order to be widely applied. An outline of the most broadly used PCR-based methods for food traceability is described. Applications in the area of detection of genetically modified organisms, protected denomination of origin, allergenic and intolerance reactions are detailed in order to understand the dimension of the performed studies.

AB How can digital tools increase national circularity measures in agriculture towards GHG reduction and other national goals? During the 26(th) Conference of Parties (COP) held in November 2021, it was clear that circularity will play a role in meeting important international targets but that the global community and national governments lack the tools to measure the contribution of circular actions in the agriculture sector towards meeting these commitments. In the absence of monitoring and decision-support tools, governments will not know the full impact of their actions towards meeting commitments. This perspective looks at the way that digital agricultural traceability systems can form the building blocks for government action to incentivize enhanced circularity in the agriculture sector and track progress towards international targets. Among the many countries working on digital traceability systems, Uruguay stands out an example of a country pushing towards systemic traceability in multiple aspects of the food system. We examine Uruguay's use of digital traceability systems for sustainable production and redefinition of green markets as an example of a rapidly modernizing digital food system and a beacon for other countries to follow. The case of Uruguay shows that digital tools can create transparency in productive systems and allow the government to target sustainability policies. By using digital traceability systems for livestock, dairy effluents, soil rotations, agricultural chemicals, and forests Uruguay is creating a replicable framework for circularity and long-term sustainable production in the agriculture sector, one policy at a time. This framework serves as a benchmark for other countries in Latin America to reach their traceability, circularity, and emissions reductions targets.

AB China is the world leader in peach production and export. Peaches are prone to rapid deterioration after harvest, especially when honey peach export chain always is longer and complex. Both traceability and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) are considered as the effective tools to improve quality control and chain transparency. This paper presents an effort to develop and evaluate a multi-sensors-managed traceability system for honey peach export chain. The key traceable information and quality control point were identified based on the principles of HACCP; a traceability system, integrated multi-sensors and a HACCP based quality control plan, was developed to monitor identified traceable information in real-time and provide the quality evaluation and control decision; The system was evaluated and validated at a sampled honey peach export chain from Shandong, China to Singapore. The results show that the critical ambient parameters (CAPs) in the honey peach export chain are temperature, relative humidity (RH), O-2, CO2 and ethylene. The temperature influences the change of RH, CO2 and ethylene. The traceability system can improve the transparency and quality control by tracing the CAPs in honey peach export chain and provide the tracking service. The quality loss of honey peach export chain decreased from 25% to 30% to below 13% based two years' statistics with the system application. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To find a promising molecular method for meat traceability, three methods of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection: RFLP-PCR analysis, high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis, and TaqMan probe analysis, have been compared in terms of accuracy, ease of use, throughput capability, and cost. We genotyped ten pork DNA samples across three SNPs. The results showed that the HRM genotyping method was the most accurate and easiest to use with the lowest cost, while TaqMan probe analysis provided similar results, but its cost was much higher.

AB Purpose
   The incredulity among Muslim consumers due to fake and doubtful halal logos has led to some querying the halal compliance and halal integrity among food small and medium enterprises (SMEs). By using the traceability systems consumers may track and trace the movement of food products available in the market. The purpose of this paper is to investigate factors that influence food SMEs' intention to adopt a halal traceability system.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A structured questionnaire survey was developed and administered to a systematic random sampling of 260 food SMEs. The data were analyzed using descriptive analysis, Chi-square analysis, Pearson correlation analysis and logistic regression analysis.
   Findings
   The results revealed a strong correlation between the environmental aspect (EA) and perceived usefulness (PU) of a halal traceability system. Sales turnover, PU, perceived ease of use, technological aspect, organizational aspect and EA are the factors that influenced food SMEs' intention to adopt a halal traceability system.
   Research limitations/implications
   The context of this study is confined to the SMEs in the food industry in Peninsular Malaysia, thereby limiting the generalizability of the findings to other industries.
   Practical implications
   This study shows a halal traceability system facilitates food SMEs in enhancing their business and provides tremendous potential to further improve the halal industry in Malaysia.
   Originality/value
   The traceability system that is perceived to be easy and useful are the most influential factors toward the adoption of technology among food SMEs. Thus, this study confirms the growing importance of the halal traceability system in the food industry.

AB Recent developments in the legal establishment and the market have motivated more agro-food companies to implement traceability systems (TS). TS play an important role not only for planning system implementation before development, but also for analyzing system performance after using the system. A novel agro-food TS model is presented here, based on comprehensive and quantifiable granularity concepts. A 2-layer index system was established; the first layer was mainly factors such as precision, breadth, and depth, and the second layer included seven indicator sub-factors: external trace units, internal flow units, IU conversion, information collection content, information update frequency, forward tracking distance, and backward tracing distance. An indicator's overall score was scaled with five contributing scores that graded the assignment method. Indicator weight was confirmed with the AHP method. The weight values of the seven indicators were 0.1985, 0.1141, 0.0872, 0.1870, 0.1248, 0.1442, and 0.1442, respectively. A weighted sum model was adopted to calculate the evaluation value. A high evaluation value indicated high granularity. The granularity model was applied in two enterprises, here identified as WPF and WFPE, which were located at different stages in wheat-flour supply chain. The survey results showed that WFPE should invest more in tracing equivalent granularity than WPF should because it involves multi-stage processing, a complicated supply chain structure, it is a large enterprise, and operates in a strict regulatory environment. Furthermore, WFPE was motivated to implement a high granularity level because of benefits in supply chain management, market and customer response, and recall and risk management. In the future, an updated granularity evaluation model that could combine enterprise characteristics and uncover hidden costs and benefits will be studied further. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In order to better detect the quality of aquatic products, a water quality and safety traceability system based on Internet of things has been designed. By analyzing the marine product quality and safety control, a standardized, intelligent and universal marine product quality safety traceability system is proposed based on the Internet of things technology and the characteristics of the seafood industry chain are analyzed. The process about "seedling purchase (seedling propagation) - seafood cultivation - seafood fishing - seafood processing - seafood sales" is selected as the main line, and sensors are used to collect seafood information. The final information is pooled into the seafood traceability data center. Companies can view the seafood traceability data in the traceability system, and consumers can obtain product traceability data by scanning the two-dimensional code of product packaging. The system adopts B/S model and SSH framework to complete system development. The experimental results show that the new system provides powerful technical support for marine product traceability and marine product quality safety management. Based on the above finding, it is concluded that the traceability system has been technically able to effectively improve the product management of marine fishery enterprises through the information management technology. At the same time, it lays a good foundation for the overall upgrading and reform of China's marine fishery industry.

AB Counterfeiting products and abusing labels lead to less credibility for traceability system in China recently. Authentication and supervision agencies driven by government departments play an important role for ensuring the quality safety in the case of lacking the willingness and credit of enterprises. A complete authentication and supervision flow framework was constructed based on an identification code (IdC) for authenticated origin base, which linked two actors of the agencies and the enterprises, and three subsystems of On-line Authentication Subsystem (OAS), Safety Production Management Client (SMC) and Mobile Supervision Application (MSA). IdC consisted of longitude and latitude of origin base as position code, production code and authentication type code. With a relative position partition method on 6 zones every 27 for China map and a coordination transformation algorithm, an absolute longitude and latitude value was converted into a relative position value and a zone mark value. IdC and packaging date code formed initial traceability code (TC). 8 digits packaging date code was reconstructed into 3 digits relative time value and 1 digit period mark according to a relative time period partition method with a period of 999d as time intervals and four periods form a cycle. Validation code was generated integrating the zone mark value, period mark value and authentication type code. Therefore, transformed 20 digits TC with the characters of shorter code length and stronger encryption was formed with IdC, relative time value and validation code. Three subsystems for different actors which provide the main function such as origin base registration, agency authentication, QR code generation, data uploading and product verification, were developed. The system has been used in Tianjin city from 2012. 213 enterprises were audited through OAS and used SMC. Through investigating 8 supervision agency staffs, 30 origin base owners, and 50 customers, it is shown that the positive effects are approved by most of the investigators and two negative effects for enhancing the costs and doubting the authentication reliability are laid by 17 enterprises and 12 customers. Furthermore, 4 typical cases for counterfeiting and abusing the labels were exampled and can be solved to a certain extent with the system. However, except for the technology itself, a management measures fitting the supervision flow and system need to draft in order to improve the system application well in the future.

AB Background and Objectives This article analyses the approach of identifying critical traceability events (CTE) and corresponding key data elements (KDE). The CTE-KDE approach is evidence-based that identifies, and documents activities. It can be easily performed by (i) auditors; (ii) food manufacturers/processors; (iii) food suppliers to access gaps in process and supply chain. For example, for a grain processor storage of grain is identified as a CTE performed under grain elevator, and the necessary KDE includes the location of storage bin and supplier details. The CTE-KDE approach requires verifiable data, and the ability to assess graduated levels of success based on data. This article proposes the use of vulnerability analysis to predict levels of success in each CTE-KDE situation. Significance and Novelty A vulnerability analysis model identifies, quantifies, and prioritizes various factors responsible for reducing the efficacy of a system. Vulnerability analysis measures system attributes (data) related to: (i) frequency of occurrence; (ii) degree of impact of occurrence; and (iii) likelihood of detection. This article applies vulnerability analysis as a standard method for identifying when and how a traceability system will fail. Vulnerability analysis of an evidence-based CTE-KDE framework accounts for complex interactions among supply chain participants' critical activities. The need for standard measures of evaluating traceability systems is clear. Such analysis must restrict CTE to be measurable events and key data elements to measurable system attributes.

AB Traceability plays a vital role in food quality and safety management. Traditional Internet of Things (IoT) traceability systems provide the feasible solutions for the quality monitoring and traceability of food supply chains. However, most of the IoT solutions rely on the centralized server-client paradigm that makes it difficult for consumers to acquire all transaction information and to track the origins of products. Blockchain is a cutting-edge technology that has great potential for improving traceability performance by providing security and full transparency. However, the benefits, challenges and development methods of blockchain-based food traceability systems are not yet fully explored in the current literature. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to review the blockchain technology characteristics and functionalities, identify blockchain-based solutions for addressing food traceability concerns, highlight the benefits and challenges of blockchain-based traceability systems implementation, and help researchers and practitioners to apply blockchain technology based food traceability systems by proposing an architecture design framework and suitability application analysis flowchart of blockchain based food traceability systems. The results of this study contribute to better understanding and knowledge on how to improve the food traceability by developing and implementing blockchain-based traceability systems. The paper provides valuable information for researchers and practitioners on the use of blockchain-based food traceability management and has a positive effect on the improvement of food sustainability.

AB The agricultural traceability system provides information transparency throughout the agricultural supply chain. This paper applies game theory to analyse the traceability system used by the herbal product industry in order to elucidate the strategic choices made by government authorities, farmers (e.g. producers), certification agencies, and consumers. This paper clarifies how relevant variables affect the traceability system employed in the herbal product industry. The analysis yields strong results and indicates a superior equilibrium; the observed strategic choices comprise active traceability system promotion by authorities, development of a comprehensive traceability system by farmers, maintenance of independence by certification agencies, and purchase of herbal products by consumers. The traceability system and existing herbal product safety programs must be refined because they are crucial to consumers, farmers, and people who support agricultural communities. These results contribute to the literature in the field, serving as a reference for members of the herbal product industry, government authorities, and academics.

AB The adoption of a proper traceability system is being incorporated into meat production practices as a method of gaining consumer confidence. The various partners operating in the chain of meat production can be considered a social network, and they have the common goal of generating a communication process that can ensure each characteristic of the product, including safety. This study aimed to select the most appropriate meat traceability system "from farm to fork" that could be applied to Brazilian beef and pork production for international trade. The research was done in three steps. The first used the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) for selecting the best on-farm livestock traceability. In the second step, the actors in the meat production chain were identified to build a framework and defined each role in the network. In the third step, the selection of the traceability system was done. Results indicated that with an electronic traceability system, it is possible to acquire better connections between the links in the chain and to provide the means for managing uncertainties by creating structures that facilitate information flow more efficiently.

AB Consumers have a right to safer foods, and traceability is one approach to meeting their expectations. Kenya does not have an operational animal traceability system, and while a few initiatives have been piloted, these have only focused on the beef value chain. In this paper, we begin a discussion on traceability in the pig value chain, with an initial focus on smallholder systems of Western Kenya. First, a background to local pig production is given, and a description of animal identification and traceability options applicable to these systems is explained. Based on this, a "butcher-to-farm" traceability system, with health, production and food safety as objectives, is discussed. Requirements for establishing such a system (including actor incentives) are additionally discussed. The proposed approach can be piloted in the field and findings used to inform the design of a larger pilot and possibly pave way for implementation of a national traceability system, in line with the guidelines provided by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Organized systems in the area (including commercial producer and trader groups) would offer a useful starting point.

AB With the growing popularity of complex dynamic activities in manufacturing processes, traceability of the entire life of every product has drawn significant attention especially for food, clinical materials, and similar items. This paper studies the traceability issue in cyber-physical manufacturing systems from a theoretical viewpoint. Petri net models are generalized for formulating dynamic manufacturing processes, based on which a detailed approach for enabling traceability analysis is presented. Models as well as algorithms are carefully designed, which can trace back the lifecycle of a possibly contaminated item. A practical prototype system for supporting traceability is designed, and a real-life case study of a quality control system for bee products is presented to validate the effectiveness of the approach.

AB Implementation of food traceability systems in China faces many challenges due to the scale, diversity, and complexity of China's food supply chains. This study aims to identify critical success factors specific to the implementation of traceability systems in China. Twenty-seven critical success factors were identified in the literature. Interviews with managers at four food enterprises in a prestudy helped identify success criteria and five additional critical success factors. These critical success factors were tested through a survey of managers in 83 food companies. This study identifies six dimensions for critical success factors: laws, regulations, and standards; government support; consumer knowledge and support; effective management and communication; top management, company wide, and vendor support; and information and system quality.

AB In the context of epidemic prevention and control, food safety monitoring, data analysis and food safety traceability have become more important. At the same time, the most important reason for food safety issues is incomplete, opaque, and asymmetric information. The most fundamental way to solve these problems is to do a good job of traceability, and establish a reasonable and reliable food safety traceability system. The traceability system is currently an important means to ensure food quality and safety and solve the crisis of trust between consumers and the market. Research on food safety traceability systems based on big data, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things provides ideas and methods to solve the problems of low credibility and difficult data storage in the application of traditional traceability systems. Therefore, this research takes rice as an example and proposes a food safety traceability system based on RFID two-dimensional code technology and big data storage technology in the Internet of Things. This article applies RFID technology to the entire system by analyzing the requirements of the system, designing the system database and database tables, encoding the two-dimensional code and generating the design for information entry. Using RFID radio frequency technology and the data storage function in big data to obtain information in the food production process. Finally, the whole process of food production information can be traced through the design of dynamic query platform and mobile terminal. In this research, the food safety traceability system based on big data and the Internet of Things guarantees the integrity, reliability and safety of traceability information from a technical level. This is an effective solution for enhancing the credibility of traceability information, ensuring the integrity of information, and optimizing the data storage structure.

AB In livestock, breed assignment may play a key role in the certification of products linked to specific breeds. Traceability of farm animals and authentication of their products can contribute to improve breed profitability and sustainability of animal productions with significant impact on the rural economy of particular geographic areas and on breed and biodiversity conservation. With the goal of developing a breed genetic traceability system for Girgentana dairy products, the aim of this study was to identify specific microsatellite markers able to discriminate among the most important Sicilian dairy goat breeds, in order to detect possible adulteration in Girgentana dairy products. A total of 20 microsatellite markers were analyzed on 338 individual samples from Girgentana, Maltese, and Derivata di Siria goat breeds. Specific microsatellite markers useful for traceability of dairy products were identified. Eight microsatellite markers showed alleles present at the same time in Maltese and Derivata di Siria and absent in Girgentana and, therefore, they were tested on DNA pools of the three breeds. Considering the electropherograms' results, only FCB20, SRCRSP5, and TGLAl22 markers were tested on DNA samples extracted from cheeses of Girgentana goat breed. These three microsatellite markers could be applied in a breed genetic traceability system of Girgentana dairy products in order to detect adulteration due to Maltese and Derivata di Siria goat breeds.

AB In China, there is a renewed interest in traceability systems as an efficient tool to guarantee pork safety. One of the pathways through which a traceability system can benefit consumers is by easing information asymmetry. However, past literature on the traceability system in China pays more attention to theoretical analysis and less to empirical analysis. Using a large-scale survey of pig farms in China, we investigate the effects influencing farmers' participation in the traceability system. Findings show that a traceability system can influence the safety of pork indirectly through its impacts on farmers' production behaviors. Another important finding is that unsafe pork is a result of non-standard use of veterinary drugs, and the traceability system works well for farmers by pushing them to take stricter safety measurements.

TI Design Framework of a Traceability System for the Rice Agroindustry

SO INFORMATION

ID INFORMATION; MANAGEMENT
AB Rice is a vital food commodity in Indonesia due to its role as a staple food for most Indonesian people. The rice supply chain in Indonesia varies from one region to another and it is difficult to trace movement along the chain from land to customers. This introduces non-transparency and uncertainty in the quantity and quality of rice at every node along the supply chain. The crucial issues of food safety and security, as well as consumer concern and curiosity in buying and consuming foods, increases the need for a traceability system for the rice value chain which can be easily and widely accessed. This paper describes the design framework of an IT (Information Technology)-based traceability system for the rice supply chain on web platforms. The system approach has been followed (where the system requirements are identified based on supply chain characteristics) and then the logical framework for implementing internal and external traceability was modeled using IDEF-0 (Integrated Definition Modeling). This paper further presents an explanation of the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) as an initial step to modeling the data requirements and a model of information exchange between stakeholders that explains the data that must be recorded and forwarded to the next stakeholder. Finally, we propose the CBIS (Computer Based Information System) concept to develop a traceability system in the rice supply chain.

AB Traditional traceability system has problems of centralized management, opaque information, untrustworthy data, and easy generation of information islands. To solve the above problems, this paper designs a traceability system based on blockchain technology for storage and query of product information in supply chain of agricultural products. Leveraging the characteristics of decentralization, tamper-proof and traceability of blockchain technology, the transparency and credibility of traceability information increased. A dual storage structure of "database + blockchain" on-chain and off-chain traceability information is constructed to reduce load pressure of the chain and realize efficient information query. Blockchain technology combined with cryptography is proposed to realize the safe sharing of private information in the blockchain network. In addition, we design a reputation-based smart contract to incentivize network nodes to upload traceability data. Furthermore, we provide performance analysis and practical application, the results show that our system improves the query efficiency and the security of private information, guarantees the authenticity and reliability of data in supply chain management, and meets actual application requirements.

AB Background: Food safety has garnered much worldwide attention recently for reasons that are, unfortunately, not always positive. Traceability system (TS) is designed to assure safe and good quality food, while reducing the costs of food recalls. It should encompass all stakeholders, including governments, companies, and consumers, each of whom has an important role in the implementation and guardianship of such systems. The EU and China are amongst the main players implementing TS and are constantly exploring new opportunities and monitoring challenges for TS in a time of shifting consumer demands and rapid new technology innovation.
   Scope and approach: This article states development stages from TS 1.0 to 3.0. and reviews TS development in a number of key countries and regions. Comparisons between the EU and China are drawn in terms of government, corporate, and consumer involvement in traceability.
   Key findings and conclusions: A functional TS, while providing bi-directional communication between trading partners, must meet the laws and regulations where it operates. A functional system must also consider consumer value and perception, which varies with geography. There are a variety of promising technologies available on the market today to modernize TS, including artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain. A key finding of this research is that both the EU and China have developed significant trade links in recent years which will certainly positively impact both economies. Key to underpinning the sustainability of these trade links will be the adoption of common TS to prevent negative associations.

AB There are not or weak anti-counterfeit functions in the current traceability system. As a result, the counterfeiters could imitate this system easily. This phenomenon had a large impact on the traceability system construction and on consumer trust in the traceability information. The aim of our research was to construct an anti-counterfeit code for aquatic product identification, for traceability and supervision of aquatic enterprises in the domestic market. The aquatic products batch code (APBC) was in the form of a segmented combination encoding an enterprise identification code, a product code and a check code, which implements a combination of traceability and supervision. An encryption algorithm based on the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) was designed for decimal anti-counterfeit code based on the unique identification of the aquatic trace units. Simulation tests indicated that a diffusion rate of greater than 90% was achieved when the encryption was run four or more times, thereby leading to the implementation of an anti-counterfeiting technique for aquatic traceability, known as "one time, one code". The anti-counterfeit code combined with GS1 was used in a product label, and the method has a high level of security and is used for supervision and tracing of aquatic products in China.

AB The goat and sheep meat producer chain has developed in last years, thus, it is imperative to organize and structure the supply chain and to adopt reliable policies for products' traceability, as a tool to achieve these requirements. The study aimed to make a management program with a traceability model for goat and sheep meat production, with emphasis on ensuring product origin and management practices' transparency at the animal production unit. For this purpose, it was made a reference model in order to emit an origin certificate which, in turn, provides specific information concerning the final product from each unit. Secondly, the program was developed using Hipertext Preprocessor (PHP) technology and as for the Database Management System, it was used MySQL. The schematic model proposed meets the requirements of a traceability system for goat and sheep meat. Furthermore, the program can work as a tool for farm management, by reports and real-time remote access to information.

AB An effective and trustworthy traceability system contributes to improving food quality and safety and responds to consumers' demand for food provenance information. Safe meat and its products are crucial to consumers and society. Livestock feeding regime and geographical origin are closely related to the properties and the safety of animal origin food, but the information is often invisible to consumers, which makes is easier to use fraudulent practices throughout the whole supply chain. Technologies and their proper use in traceability systems are important for the safety of animal origin foods. An essential component in an integrated traceability chain includes individual animal identification and trace back of related meat products. In this review, we examine the technologies for individual animal identification, including the radio frequency identification system and DNA fingerprinting. For meat products, traceability technologies focus on the chemical components fingerprinting, including measurement of stable isotope ratios, mineral element tracing and organic component fingerprinting. Also, future trends in food traceability systems need to be improved to promote the establishment of more efficient and trustworthy traceability systems to ensure food safety and quality up to standard.

AB Traceability systems are perceived as a powerful solution to cope with food safety issues. It is important to improve the traceability for food supply chains to address potential food safety events. This paper studies the sourcing decisions in a food supply chain, in which the buyer is exposed to potential food safety events due to supplier responsibility. It is shown that the buyer may fail to source from the supplier with high-level traceability on account of information asymmetry. To address this adverse selection problem, this paper employs the certification as a screening tool, and find that the buyer could separate the two types perfectly with a pooling contract with certification, if the probability of the high type is low; otherwise, a pooling contract only separate the two types partially. This paper further considers a setting in which traceability strengthens the food safety level. It is shown that the buyer prefers the supplier with high-level traceability even the unit cost incurred by food safety events or the probability of the supplier with high-level traceability is lower.

AB Based on the survey data and information, this paper conducts analysis on the extra cost of traceability systems for agro-product enterprises in China. Calculation on concrete pricing of traceable products is conducted with Enterprise A as an example by using break-even pricing. The price that consumers are willing to pay for 10 traceable products in Enterprise A was measured by collecting 576 valid questionnaires in three cities in China. The benefit-cost ratio, contribution margin ration and profit growth rate are figured before and after implementing the traceability system to illustrate if Enterprise A is profitable after implementing the traceability system. The results show that extra cost incurred by the traceability system of Enterprise A is not high in China; it is not the main reason for the high price of traceable products. Enterprise A increases its operating efficiency and profit growth rate after implementing the traceability system. The pricing of traceable product should consider target consumers' willingness to pay rather than setting prices blindingly. Government support and education to consumers are important to promote the construction of traceability system at the early stage of establishment of traceability system in China.

AB Waterless live transportation is an effective strategy to realize a larger volume of live fish, and it is pollution-free by contrast with traditional live transport with water. Based on previous study results, this paper aims to propose the knowledge-based HACCP quality control plan to realize real-time feedback and adjustment for fish waterless live transportation. Meantime, the improved traceability system was established to realize the CCPs determination and non-destructive dynamic monitoring of fish stress level in waterless live transportation. Furthermore, to verify the accuracy and applicability of the established traceability system, the relevant manager, workers, and experts are invited to participate in the efficiency and performance analysis. The final results show that the accuracy of the forecasting model is 96.7%, and all the regression coefficients are close to 1.00. Besides, the improved traceability system would offer a better solution of effective quality control for the fish waterless live transportation, and help to improve the transport management efficiency.

ID FRAMEWORK; FOOD; AGRIBUSINESS; QUALITY; SAFETY; SYSTEM
AB BACKGROUND: Tilapia has been named as the 'food fish of the 21st century' and has become the most important farmed fish. China is the world leader in tilapia production and export. Identifying information and functional requirements is critical in developing an efficient traceability system because traceability has become a fundamental prerequisite for exporting aquaculture products.
   RESULTS: This paper examines the export-oriented tilapia chains and information flow in the chains, and identifies the key actors, information requirements and information-capturing points. Unified Modeling Language (UML) technology is adopted to describe the information and functionality requirement for chain traceability. The barriers of traceability system adoption are also identified.
   CONCLUSION: The results show that the traceability data consist of four categories that must be recorded by each link in the chain. The functionality requirement is classified into four categories from the fundamental information record to decisive quality control; the top three barriers to the traceability system adoption are: high costs of implementing the system, lack of experienced and professional staff; and low level of government involvement and support.

AB The contemporary food supply chain (FSC) should adequately provide information that consumers and other concerned bodies need to know such as variety of the food attributes, country of origin, animal welfare, and genetic engineering related issues. For this, effective food traceability system (FTS) is important. The objective of this study was to conduct a comprehensive literature review on food traceability issues. About 74 studies, mainly focusing on food traceability issues and published during 2000-2013, were reviewed. Based on the review results, the definition, driving forces, barriers in developing and implementing FTSs, benefits, traceability technologies, improvements, and performances of FTSs have been identified and discussed. Considering FTS as an integral part of logistics management, new conceptual definition of FTS has been provided. This review has pointed out that the issue of developing effective and full chain FTS is quite complex in nature as it requires a deeper understanding of real processes from different perspectives such as economic, legal, technological, and social issues. Therefore, future researches (recommended here) on traceability should focus on: integration of traceability activities with food logistics activities; technological aspects of FTSs; the linkage between traceability system and food production units; standardization of data capturing and information exchange; awareness creation strategies; continuity of information flow and effective communication of traceability information to consumers and other stakeholders; the linkage between different drivers of FTS; improvement strategies of FTS; and development of performance evaluation frameworks for FTSs.

AB Food safety and traceability are nowadays a constant concern for consumers, and indeed for all actors in the food chain, including those involved in the fruit and vegetable sector. For the EU, the principles and legal requirements of traceability are set out in Regulation 178/2002. Currently however the regulation does not describe any analytical traceability tools. Furthermore, traceability systems for fruits and vegetables face increasing competition due to market globalization. The current challenge for actors in this sector is therefore to be sufficiently competitive in terms of price, traceability, quality and safety to avoid scandal and fraud. For all these reasons, new, flexible, cheap and efficient traceability tools, as isotopic analysis, DNA fingerprinting and metabolomic profiling coupled with chemometrics are needed.

AB In recent years, traceability systems have been developed as practical tools for improving supply chain (SC) transparency and visibility, especially in health and safety-sensitive sectors like food and pharmaceuticals. Blockchain-related SC traceability research has received significant attention during the last several years, and arguably blockchain is currently the most promising technology for providing traceability-related services in SC networks. This paper provides a systematic literature review of the various technical implementation aspects of blockchain-enabled SC traceability systems. We apply different drivers for classifying the selected literature, such as (a) the various domains of the available blockchain-enabled SC traceability systems and relevant methodologies applied; (b) the implementation maturity of these traceability systems along with technical implementation details; and (c) the sustainability perspective (economic, environmental, social) prevalent to these implementations. We provide key takeaways regarding the open issues and challenges of current blockchain traceability implementations and fruitful future research areas. Despite the significant volume and plethora of blockchain-enabled SC traceability systems, academia has so far focused on unstructured experimentation of blockchain-associated SC traceability solutions, and there is a clear need for developing and testing real-life traceability solutions, especially taking into account feasibility and cost-related SC aspects.

AB Traceability ensures a link between carcass, quarters or cuts of beef and the individual animal or the group of animals from which they are derived. Meat traceability is an essential tool for successful identification and recall of contaminated products from the market during a food crisis. Meat traceability is also extremely important for protection and value enhancement of good-quality brands. Molecular meat traceability would allow verification of conventional methods used for beef tracing in synthetic Mexican bovine breeds. We evaluated a set of 11 microsatellites for their ability to identify animals belonging to these synthetic breeds, Brangus and Charolais/Brahman (78 animals). Seven microsatellite markers allowed sample discrimination with a match probability, defined as the probability of finding two individuals sharing by chance the same genotypic profile, of 10(-8). The practical application of the marker set was evaluated by testing eight samples from carcasses and pieces of meat at the slaughterhouse and at the point of sale. The DNA profiles of the two samples obtained at these two different points in the production-commercialization chain always proved that they came from the same animal.

AB Traceability has become a prerequisite for ensuring meat quality and safety. It is the most critical requirement for developing a well-structured traceability system to identify efficiently and model the traceability information need to be captured. This article identified Chinese domestic sheep meat supply chain and proposed the Petri nets and UML based modeling approach for identified traceability information and process. This approach followed the definition of state and transition in sheep meat production process. An in-depth analysis was conducted for the sheep stakeholders and production flow of the sheep meat chain. The state-transition for the production process and specific traceability information need to be captured were identified including the product, process, quality, and transformation information. Furthermore, traceability functionality requirement and system architecture were presented. System evaluation results illustrate the model can help to provide guidance for standardizing meat product flow and supporting quality traceability management in meat industry. The system can provide making-decision for the meat product quality and safety control. Practical applications The proposed method could be applied widely in development of traceability system and provided making-decision for the control of meat product quality and safety.

AB BACKGROUNDWe applied game theory to the organic tea certification process and traceability system used by the Taiwanese tea industry to elucidate the strategic choices made by tea farmers and organic tea certification agencies. Thus, this paper clarifies how relevant variables affect the organic certification process and traceability system used within the tea industry.
   RESULTSThe findings indicate that farmers who generate high revenues experience failures regarding tea deliveries, cash outflow, damage compensation, and quasi-rent. An additional problem included the high costs yielded when tea farmers colluded with or switched organic tea certification agencies. Furthermore, there could be decreasing levels of personal interest in planting non-organic tea and lowering the costs of planting organic tea and the managerial accounting costs of building comprehensive traceability systems; thus, the analysis yielded strong results and a superior equilibrium.
   CONCLUSIONThis research is unprecedented, using an innovative model and providing a novel analysis structure for use in the tea industry. These results contribute to the field of literature and should serve as a valuable reference for members of the tea industry, government, and academia. (c) 2014 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Aiming at the problems of current commercial river crab quality safety, hard to distinguish between real and false Yangcheng Lake hairy crabs, and too large feature dimension of deep residual network extraction, a precise source tracing system of river crab based on improved deep residual network is proposed. The system consists of four parts: breed, detection, sale and traceability. In breed, detection and sale parts, the data of crab breed, detection and sale are stored in traceability database. The traceability part identifies whether there is traceable river in traceability database by identifying crab based on improved deep residual network. According to the result of identification, the data of crab breeding, testing and marketing are output. Finally, the precise traceability of each commercial crab from consumer to farm is realized. The improved crab identification technology of the deep residual network can reduced the extracted crab shell feature vector from 2 048 to 156 dimensions, the recognition time is reduced by 92%, and the recognition accuracy is 92.1%.

AB In the Veneto region (northern Italy), some geographic areas in the Po Valley have a large concentration of industrial poultry farms and are located close to wet areas with high populations of wild waterfowl. Live decoy birds belonging to the orders of Anseriformes and Charadriiformes can constitute a "bridge" for avian influenza (AI) viruses between the wild reservoir and the rural holdings where live decoy birds are usually kept, sometimes together with poultry. Thus, the use of live decoy birds during bird hunting could increase the risk of exposure of poultry farms to AI viruses. Since 2008, this kind of hunting has been strictly regulated with regard to the detection and use of live decoy birds. In order to guarantee the application of appropriate AI risk-modulating and monitoring measures in the management of the live decoys according to the European Union (EU) provisions, a solid and well-structured information system has been created. The Regional Data Bank (RDB) of farms and livestock, which has been operating since 1997, also contains data on farms and poultry movements. Therefore, the RDB management software was updated to collect data from the hunters who keep live decoy birds, and specific functions were integrated to ensure the traceability of these birds. Each live decoy bird has been identified by an irremovable ring. The individual code of each ring is recorded in the RDB and linked to both the holder's code and the hunting area. Transfers and death/slaughtering of the registered birds are recorded, too. The activation of a computerized data collection system has proven to be a prerequisite for the implementation of a control system for live decoy birds and provides an essential tool for the management of AI emergencies.

AB Traceability of data through transformation stages of each individual food product, starting from raw products and to the final product, as well as printing the key data on the product package, adds to the consumers' trust in product quality. For each food product, it is necessary to track data starting from the stage of raw products farming, through food processing, transport, warehousing, to retailing and reaching the end consumer. In order to allow insight to the key data to the user (mostly end consumer), this paper suggests recording the data on the product package in the form of a quick response two-dimensional barcode (QR code) in key points of the product's life cycle. For efficient functioning of the proposed system, it is essential to ensure fast and reliable operation through proper placement of the QR code on the package during production, and fast and easy data reading by the product consumer. This paper presents the results of a readability analysis of QR code of variable contents, size and data error correction level, which are read by smartphones running an Android platform. The experiments were performed with various types of base material on which the code was printed. Furthermore, QR code readability analysis was conducted in the case when there is a geometric deformation of the code. Based on the detailed analysis of the collected data, it can be concluded that QR code readability is not directly influenced by the number of coded characters, or by the error correction level, but only by the size of modules that constitute the code. Furthermore, the results show that the change of the base material does not influence the read time, but influences the code readability. The paper further presents an example of the proposed traceability system, where the QR codes are used for data tracking and tracing for fruit yogurts, based on the recommendations gained through the readability analysis. This traceability system concept is universal and can be used for various products with slight modifications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Traceability is important in maintenance of food safety and quality at each stage of the food supply chain, particularly in identification of contamination sources and routes in meat, poultry and seafood. There are a variety of identification techniques for individual animals, batches of similar sources and for types of products. Each species has unique harvesting, processing, storage and distribution characteristics which influence identification methods and subsequent systems for tracking information to end users and tracing information back to source. Record keeping and data management are key components of a successful traceability system. Radio frequency identification (RFID) is often used for pallet, case and individual package identification and tracing, but bar coding and quick response technologies are being integrated into some production and marketing schemes for inventory control and the conveying of desired information to processors and consumers. Systems using multiple flexible reading and recording technologies and centralized internet data access allow the many different components in the meat, poultry and seafood industries to be linked together.

AB Wheat flour undergoes several processing steps in its transformation from raw wheat in the mill, which differentiates wheat flour from other farm products. At each step, various wheat sources are combined into one batch of wheat flour. This study primarily aimed to develop a Wheat Flour Milling Traceability System (WFMTS), incorporating 2D barcode and radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, and to validate the system in a wheat flour mill in China. We designed the encoding rules for the raw material, processing and traceability batches. Labels with a Quick Response Code (QR Code) were attached to small packages of wheat flour to link them to their processing information, and RFID tags were affixed to the storage bins to record logistics information. A traceability system was developed based on batch identification and record keeping. The system was applied and supported in a wheat flour mill for one year. The WFMTS management and traceability capacity was evaluated using a contrast experiment. The experiment was divided into five parts, including raw material data recording, processing data recording, package data recording, logistics data recording and traceability query. The results show that although time consumption using WFMTS in package data recording was more than that with paper recording. WFMTS was dominant in its total time consumption: five parts were reduced by 113%, and the mean accuracy of the five parts increased by 8%. The QR Code and RFID recognition accuracy was evaluated using experiments with different reading distances. The cost and income variations in application WFMTS were analyzed based on the survey. The results show that the total cost increased by 17.2% to apply the system. Compared to the cost, the sales income increase was obvious, and it reached 32.5%. Considering the good evaluation results, the system has good application potential in medium or large wheat mill enterprises. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A significant proportion of fresh products either does not reach the market due to quality deterioration or reaches the consumer in poor condition raising concerns about marketing and public health. Latest advances in sensing and communication technologies in agriculture and agri-food supply chain, facilitate traceability, monitoring the products throughout the whole supply chain, starting from in-field production and through all steps of transportation, processing, and marketing. In this work, an IoT-based web and android-based platform is proposed which will monitor and guarantee the quality of the fresh products through a traceability system. The system supports enhanced communication between sellers and traders and includes all the significant steps from the farm to the storage, processing, packaging, transportation and placement at the store's shelf and the final receiver, the consumer. Thus, this work contributes with new knowledge, providing an overview of the design of integrated system for advanced traceability of fresh produce.

AB For voluntary traceability programs, a key interest for program designers and policy-makers is how to encourage participation. We contend that participating in voluntary traceability can be viewed as a product characteristic, and thus serves as a source of product differentiation. We study the implicit market for traceability systems for the first known time. In our empirical example, we use stated choice experiments to link feeder cattle sellers and buyers through premiums and discounts for cattle traceability systems. Using results from discrete choice models, we simulate changes in traceability supply and demand in response to prices and policies. We find that cost-share policies might be an effective way of encouraging participation for feeder cattle sellers and could serve as an alternative to mandating traceability.

AB Tricholoma matsutake (T. matsutake) is a special type of fungus known as "the king of bacteria", and has the very high economic value. However, it is also very difficult to transport due to its corruptibility. Therefore, tracing and tracking the quality and safety of T. matsutake in the cold chain is very important and necessary. Based on changes in the cold chain environmental parameters determine the safety of T. matsutake is a viable option. This paper developed and tested a real-time monitoring traceability system (RM-TM) using emerging Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for monitoring the cold chain logistics environmental parameters of T. matsutake. Finally, system testing and evaluation have shown that RM-TM can track and monitor temperature, humidity, oxygen and carbon dioxide fluctuations in the cold chain in real-time. In addition, the collected data can be used to increase the transparency of cold chain logistics and to more effectively control quality, safety, and traceability. In general, the system evaluation results show that it is reliable and meets the requirements of users.

AB Food authentication and origin traceability are popular research topics, especially as concerns about food quality continue to increase. Mass spectrometry (MS) plays an indispensable role in food authentication and origin traceability. In this review, the applications of MS in food authentication and origin traceability by analyzing the main components and chemical fingerprints or profiles are summarized. In addition, the characteristic markers for food authentication are also reviewed, and the advantages and disadvantages of MS-based techniques for food authentication, as well as the current trends and challenges, are discussed. The fingerprinting and profiling methods, in combination with multivariate statistical analysis, are more suitable for the authentication of high-value foods, while characteristic marker-based methods are more suitable for adulteration detection. Several new techniques have been introduced to the field, such as proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry, ambient ionization mass spectrometry (AIMS), and ion mobility mass spectrometry, for the determination of food adulteration due to their fast and convenient analysis. As an important trend, the miniaturization of MS offers advantages, such as small and portable instrumentation and fast and nondestructive analysis. Moreover, many applications in food authentication are using AIMS, which can help food authentication in food inspection/field analysis. This review provides a reference and guide for food authentication and traceability based on MS.

AB The paper is investigating the electronic-based traceability systems (ETsystems) that are considered as a valuable tool for the assurance of food safety and quality, for guaranteeing value added to products and ultimately, for serving the transparency and sustainability of agri-food chains. The objective of this research is to investigate the factors influencing the acceptance and use of ETsystems in agri-food chains.
   A model that identifies the most significant factors influencing farmers' and processors' behavior regarding the installation and operation of an ETsystem is proposed. The theoretical approach is based on a combination of the Technology Acceptance Model 2 (TAM2) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The theoretical concept and related hypotheses are tested by means of PLS-SEM analysis of data from the dairy supply chain in Greece.
   'Perceived Control' and most importantly, the 'perceived costs' over the installation and operation of the ETsystem, is the most important factor with the strongest direet effect influencing the intention to install and operate such a system. This effect is stronger in the case of dairy farmers than in the case of dairy processors. Stronger for dairy farmers is also the identification mechanism thus, their need to comply with their social/business group expectations.
   Useful findings offered for policy makers and regulators interested in the way traceability systems could be successfully integrated within an agri-food sector to guarantee its added value. The limitation of voluntariness and the enforcement of certain mandatory requirements is one tool to exploit and, based on our study, would be more effective at the processors' level.

ID INFORMATION; SYSTEMS
AB The presence of outliers in tea traceability data can mislead customers and have a significant impact on the reputation and profits of tea companies. To solve this problem, an unsupervised outlier detection mechanism for tea traceability data is proposed. Firstly, tea traceability data is uploaded to the MySQL database, and then the data is preprocessed to aggregate features based on relevance, which makes it easier to identify abnormal features. Secondly, the LOKI algorithm based on Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Isolation Forest (IForest), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithms is used to achieve unsupervised outlier detection of tea traceability data. In addition, a Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN-based) tuning method for unsupervised outlier detection algorithms is also provided. Finally, the types of anomalies among the identified outliers are identified to investigate the causes of the anomalies in order to develop remedial procedures to eliminate the anomalies, and the analysis results are fed back to the tea companies. Experiments on real datasets show that the DBSCAN-based tuning method can effectively help the unsupervised outlier detection algorithm optimize the parameters, and that the LOF-KNN-IForest (LOKI) algorithm can effectively identify the outliers in tea traceability data. This proves that the unsupervised outlier detection mechanism for tea traceability data can effectively guarantee the quality of tea traceability data.

AB Objective: This paper aims to analyse the process management in the traceability system LeTtrA Q of goat and sheep milk, and thus contribute to the knowledge of the business value chain in Andalusia.
   Methodology: Five process management variables were studied: sample status (EM), sample results (RM), time from the sample collection to the reception in the laboratory (TT-R), time from sample reception to its analysis (TR-A), and the total time from the sample collection to its analysis (TT-A). A sample of 84,484 goat milk (628 farms) and 7,507 sheep milk (53 farms) was analyzed. A non-parametric analysis of variance was applied to the qualitative variables, while an univariate analysis was performed to the quantitative variables.
   Results: The comparative analysis has shown significant differences in the process management variables for the factor year and type of laboratory.
   Limitations: This study focuses on a single case study resulting in a limited generalization of its findings.
   Practical implications: The study of process management in the agri-food system contributes to the improvement of food security and it is a useful tool to enhance the technical-economic management of the farms.

AB BACKGROUNDThe main export varieties in China are brand-name, high-quality bred aquatic products. Among them, tilapia has become the most important and fast-growing species since extensive consumer markets in North America and Europe have evolved as a result of commodity prices, year-round availability and quality of fresh and frozen products. As the largest tilapia farming country, China has over one-third of its tilapia production devoted to further processing and meeting foreign market demand.
   RESULTSUsing by tilapia fillet processing, this paper introduces the efforts for developing and evaluating ITS-TF: an intelligent traceability system integrated with statistical process control (SPC) and fault tree analysis (FTA). Observations, literature review and expert questionnaires were used for system requirement and knowledge acquisition; scenario simulation was applied to evaluate and validate ITS-TF performance.
   CONCLUSIONThe results show that traceability requirement is evolved from a firefighting model to a proactive model for enhancing process management capacity for food safety; ITS-TF transforms itself as an intelligent system to provide functions on early warnings and process management by integrated SPC and FTA. The valuable suggestion that automatic data acquisition and communication technology should be integrated into ITS-TF was achieved for further system optimization, perfection and performance improvement.

AB In this study, traceability in pork profile information with ex-ante quality assurance and ex-post traceability are constructed. Consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for traceability information is investigated in Wuxi, China, by combining the Multiple Price Lists method and the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) experimental auction. The main factors affecting consumers' WTP are also analyzed using a Tobit model. The results demonstrate that consumers have higher WTP for ex-ante quality assurance than for ex-post traceability. The highest WTP is for the ex-ante quality assurance attribute of pork quality inspection. Consumers' WTP for traceability information is influenced by their individual characteristics, including age, education and income, as well as their concern and satisfaction about food safety and confidence in food safety labeling. The contribution of this paper is that it improves the meaning of traceable food information attributes and measures the significance of attributes to consumers. Furthermore, this paper introduces a Becker-DeGroot-Marschak experimental auction method which amends the measurement deviation of hypothetical experiments.

AB Food traceability systems allow the consumers or administrative authorities to trace the origins or ingredients of food products. Given the expressed concerns for food safety, the promotion of food traceability systems has occurred in many countries. Although a considerable body of literature has examined the consumer responses in regard to food traceability, relatively little is known about the producers' adoption behaviors. To fill this knowledge gap, this paper investigates Taiwanese farmers' participation decision in relation to the Taiwan Agriculture and Food Traceability (TAFT) program; special attention is paid to understanding the roles of the farmers' program awareness and pesticide residue testing adoption in regard to TAFT participation. Using a national representative sample of the fruit and vegetable farmers in Taiwan, the results indicate that program awareness and pesticide residue testing adoption are the significant determinants of TAFT participation. An awareness of the government's promotion of the TAFT program and adoption of pesticide residue testing has significantly reduced TAFT non-participation by 28.2% and 21.9% points, respectively.

AB To stimulate the development and application of blockchain technology, Chinese government put forward subsidy strategy. To explore the subsidy policies under the new background, we chose a fresh supply chain with one producer, one blockchain-based traceability service provider, and one retailer as the research object, and government subsidy strategies were divided into a fixed strategy and a varying strategy. Afterward, considering the trust level of blockchain-based traceability information and consumers' preference to the blockchain-based traceability information, we revised the demand function, and three subsidy models were proposed and analyzed. Findings: (1) the varying subsidy will help the retailer, the producer, and the traceability service provider set lower prices. (2) Meanwhile, the varying subsidies offered to the blockchain-based traceability service provider and the producer will help the whole supply chain members obtain more revenues.

AB In a consumer-driven world, consumers want to experience a connection between the product that they are consuming and the product's origin. To guarantee the validity of this connection and therefore the origin attribute of the product, traceability systems are required. The main purpose of this paper is to assess current traceability systems implemented in South African sheep abattoirs, thereby establishing their ability to guarantee the origin of a carcass. Research indicated that the South African sheep abattoirs have traceability systems in place and they can guarantee the origin of a meat product. The descriptive analysis and hypothesis tests identified the tipping factor for the implementation of a traceability system, as the requirement from retail markets to which these abattoirs deliver their product.

AB Biomass production and supply for renewable energy generation should be managed well and carried out in a sustainable manner. An effective traceability system (TS) is required to provide sufficient information and assure the quality of the biomass. The objective of this study is to define and develop a TS to assure the pruning biomass quality for the production of solid biofuels and to provide guarantee to the final user that the biomass is in good condition according to recommended quality criteria. It is designed for an agricultural pruning supply chain in which farmers, biomass traders, transporters, and end users are major actors. It is based on the biofuel quality requirements required by final users and other standards such as the new European standards EN 14961-1, EN15234:1-2011, and EN14961-1:2010, which describe solid fuel quality parameters. Traceable quality parameters include origin and source of product, traded form, bale dimension, chips size distribution, moisture content, ash content, and density of biomass. In this TS, a unique product label is introduced and integrated into a smart logistics system (SLS). The TS uses information captured at different stages of the product supply chain. It enables the management of the whole pruning biomass supply chain with the support of a centralized web-based information platform, an integral part of the SLS.

AB Background: Increasing consumer demands for more information about the food we eat, in combination with a greater incidence of sophisticated food fraud cases, has resulted in the development and application of rapid, non-targeted and cost effective analytical methods. Vibrational spectroscopy equipment has evolved from bulky benchtop instruments to miniaturised sensors that have the capability of sensitive, real-time and on-site monitoring of food constituents. This has been driven by advances in semi-conductor and photonic technologies, and resulted in a plethora of commercialised, portable and handheld devices that can be used at various control points in food supply chains. Scope and approach: In this review, the recent technological advances in spectroscopic devices are explored and the development of commercially available devices for food authenticity analysis is discussed. Finally, the key challenges and potential of the integration of rapid analysis into digital traceability systems for food chain actors are outlined. Key findings and conclusions: Within the last five years there has been an increase in the development of methods utilising handheld and portable spectroscopy devices, in combination with chemometric analysis, for food authenticity and traceability verification. Full connectivity of food chains between growers, processors and retailers, validated by rapid and frequent analysis, has the potential to ensure food traceability in a systematic and cost-effective way. However, more focus is needed in this area to overcome current challenges.

AB Leafy vegetables are consumed in most daily xdiets worldwide. As living standards improve, food quality, safety requirements, and nutrition are becoming increasingly important to consumers when purchasing leafy vegetables. This study proposes an evaluation and traceability method that can be used to track the nutritional quality of leafy vegetables. Employing the principles of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system combined with fault tree analysis (FTA), a traceability model for the entire production and sale process of leafy vegetables is constructed. Four common leafy vegetables, spinach, rape, lettuce, and celery are examined in this research to establish a nutritional quality index system using fuzzy mathematics subordinate function method to evaluate nutritional quality. A nutritional quality and safety traceability system based on browser/server architecture and quick response (QR) code is then designed and developed for full traceability of leafy vegetable quality. This method can ensure food safety and hygiene through the control of key factors affecting food safety throughout the entire supply chain process.

AB Due to food scandals that shocked the retailer markets, traceability systems were advocated to regain consumers' confidence and trust. However, while traceability systems can be more easily explored in modern markets, almost no traceability system can be found in traditional markets in Taiwan, especially when buying meat products. This study explored the preference and the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for traceability information of pork products in traditional markets in Taiwan. The random utility theory (RUT) with the contingent valuation method (CVM) was adopted to examine the total of 1420 valid responses in Taiwan. Results show that 80% of traditional market consumers are willing to pay more for traceability information of pork products. Specifically, when consumers (1) know the market price of pork, (2) do not often buy food in the traditional market, (3) live in south or north regions of Taiwan, (4) have a flexible buying schedule, (5) are aware of food safety due to frequently accessing health-related content through media, or (6) think pork grading is very important, they would tend to choose meat products with traceability information. The implication of this study suggests that there is an urgent desire for food safety labeling and traceability information system in traditional markets in Taiwan. Especially, those who usually shop in the higher-price markets are willing to pay the most for this traceability information.

AB There is increasing requirement to improve traceability and transparency of table grapes cold chain. Key traceability indicators including temperature, humidity and gas microenvironments (e.g., CO2, O-2, and SO2) based on table grape cold chain management need to be monitored and controlled. This paper presents a Wireless Multi-Gas-Sensors System (WGS(2)) as an effective real-time cold chain monitoring system, which consists of three units: (1) the WMN which applies the 433 MHz as the radio frequency to increase the transmission performance and forms a wireless sensor network; (2) the WAN which serves as the intermediary to connect the users and the sensor nodes to keep the sensor data without delay by the GPRS remote transmission module; (3) the signal processing unit which contains embedded software to drive the hardware to normal operation and shelf life prediction for table grapes. Then the study evaluates the WGS(2) in a cold chain scenario and analyses the monitoring data. The results show that the WGS(2) is effective in monitoring quality, and improving transparency and traceability of table grape cold chains. Its deploy ability and efficiency in implantation can enable the establishment of a more efficient, transparent and traceable table grape supply chain. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUNDBoletaceae mushrooms are wild-grown edible mushrooms that have high nutrition, delicious flavor and large economic value distributing in Yunnan Province, China. Traceability is important for the authentication and quality assessment of Boletaceae mushrooms. In this study, UV-visible and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies were applied for traceability of 247 Boletaceae mushroom samples in combination with chemometrics.
   RESULTSCompared with a single spectroscopy technique, data fusion strategy can obviously improve the classification performance in partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and grid-search support vector machine (GS-SVM) models, for both species and geographical origin traceability. In addition, PLS-DA and GS-SVM models can provide 100.00% accuracy for species traceability and have reliable evaluation parameters. For geographical origin traceability, the accuracy of prediction in the PLS-DA model by data fusion was just 64.63%, but the GS-SVM model based on data fusion was 100.00%.
   CONCLUSIONThe results demonstrated that the data fusion strategy of UV-visible and FTIR combined with GS-SVM could provide a higher synergic effect for traceability of Boletaceae mushrooms and have a good generalization ability for the comprehensive quality control and evaluation of similar foods.

AB This paper introduces a new methodology for modeling traceability information using the EPCIS framework and UML statecharts. The method follows the approach of defining states and transitions in food production. A generic model is presented and evaluated based on its practical application by providing illustrations from two supply chains; frozen mackerel production and corn wet milling processes. All states and transitions for these processes as well as the information that needs to be captured for each state are indentified. This includes the product, process and quality information. The model presented in this paper is not just another process modeling tool but is used for mapping of food production processes to provide improved description and integration of traceability information. Information exchange technologies such as EPCIS are used for monitoring events based on logistic processes. Application of current EPCIS framework for managing food traceability information is presented by mapping the transitions identified in two product chains to the EPCIS events. The corresponding quality parameters to be linked to these EPCIS events are also identified. It was practical to map food production transitions for frozen mackerel to two EPCIS events; ObjectEvent and AggregationEvent. Because, EPCIS is based on discrete recording of events and event locations and corn wet milling is a continuous process, it was not possible to map transitions to AggregationEvent. Thus, quality parameters for transformation events for corn wet milling were linked to the subsequent ObjectEvent to provide certain extent of discretization. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB While traceability has become an important aspect in managing safety-sensitive supply chains, blockchain arose as an innovative technology with great application potentials in this area. This research determines the requirements of the main stakeholders along the supply chain from agriculture to retail with regard to a blockchain-based traceability system. The resulting specification framework includes usage requirements formulated as data classes, technical requirements regarding data access, storage and processing, and interoperability requirements necessary to assure digital communication and permanent operability. General application guidelines for digital information systems are derived, and the blockchain technology is evaluated with regard to applicability. A distinction between public and sensitive data appears to be fundamental, while a two-part architecture involving a public permissioned blockchain network is proposed as a basis for a digital traceability system in the food industry.

AB Traceability systems are key to assuring food safety, creating a benefit for food supply chain components. Currently, the appearance of new technologies such as IoT and Big Data Analysis leads to a new generation of more functional, but complex, traceability systems. Organisational models based on cooperation of multiple small/medium size agents, for example of small/family farming cooperatives, play an important role in high standard agricultural production and commercialization processes. These function as both social and economic networks, with high social and economic impact in the rural areas. The case of Almeria as an example of this model was used to analyze its cooperative model. The actual traceability systems in the Almeria model were studied, taking account of the different networked agents and their interrelation. This study includes two main parts: a) analysis of the net-chains that constitute the food supply chains and their different relationships, and b) actual traceability. The next step studied how the net-chain model, including many diverse agents, may be applied to develop a new generation of traceability systems based of IoT and Big Data. This implies extending the special and functional scope of the actual systems and defining clear rules of exchange of the results of the Big Data Analysis, taking account of the adequate Privacy Rules. This work analyses the current organisation as a base for a new generation of traceability systems considered in the European project IoF2020 (Internet of the Food and Farm 2020). Some parallels between Almeria's model and certain areas in China, mainly in the areas of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Shandong were detected. Another of the objectives of this work is to deepen the understanding of these similarities and analyze the possible adaptation of the results from Almeria to China.

AB Current food production faces a tremendous challenge due to the growing human population. The global population is estimated to reach 9 billion by 2050 with 70% more food being required. Safe food is an important dimension of food security, and food traceability across the supply chain is a key component of this. However, current food traceability systems are challenged by frequent occurrences of food safety incidents and food recalls that have damaged consumer confidence, caused huge economic loss, and put pressure on food safety agencies. This review focuses on smart food traceability that has the potential to significantly improve food safety in global food supply chains. The basic concepts and critical perspectives for various detection strategies for food safety are summarized, including portable detection devices, smart indicators and sensors integrated on food packages, and data-assisted whole-genome sequencing. In addition, new digital technologies, such as Internet-of-things (IoTs) and cloud computing, are discussed with the aim of providing readers with an overview of the exciting opportunities in smart food traceability systems.

AB The major objective of this study is to estimate Korean food shoppers' willingness to pay (WTP) for imported beef with traceability. We use an experimental elicitation method, the random nth price auction, to identify consumers' valuation for traceable imported beef. We also analyse the effect of different types of information on these valuations. Results indicate that consumers are generally willing to pay a 39 per cent premium for the traceable imported beef over similar beef without traceability. Results also suggest that in contrast to the insignificant effect of positive information, negative and two-sided information about traceability significantly reduces WTP.

AB As "natural fingerprint" of food growing environment, stable isotope abundance has attracted great attention in tracing and adulterating analysis of animal products. In recent years, the number of research papers on tracing animal products by stable isotope ratio analysis has increased. And the combination of stable isotope ratio analysis and other methods has gradually became a promising method for the authenticity and traceability of animal products. Our results summarized the latest progress of stable isotopes technology in animal products, including beef, lamb, poultry, pork, cheese, milk, and seafood, aiming to provide a reference for the application of stable isotope technology in animal products traceability.

AB The control of geographic origin is one of a highest priority issue regarding traceability and wine authenticity. The current study aimed to examine whether elemental composition can be used for the discrimination of wines according to geographical origin, taking into account the effects of soil, winemaking process, and year of production. The elemental composition of soils, grapes, musts, and wines from three DO (Designations of Origin) and for two vintage years was determined by using the ICP-MS semi-quantitative method, followed by multivariate statistical analysis. The elemental composition of soils varied according to geological formations, and for some elements, the variation due to soil provenance was also observed in musts and wines. Li, Mn, Sr and rare-earth elements (REE) allowed wine discrimination according to vineyard. Results evidenced the influence of winemaking processes and of vintage year on the wine's elemental composition. The mineral composition pattern is transferred through the soil-wine system, and differences observed for soils are reflected in grape musts and wines, but not for all elements. Results suggest that winemaking processes and vintage year should be taken into account for the use of elemental composition as a tool for wine traceability. Therefore, understanding the evolution of mineral pattern composition from soil to wine, and how it is influenced by the climatic year, is indispensable for traceability purposes.

AB Chain-wide traceability systems conforming to the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) standard which is a well-recognized global standard allow supply chain operators to digitally capture and directly access the traceability data within and across enterprises. Although recent studies proposed the cloud-based deployment of EPCIS-based traceability systems by which supply chain operators are likely to save their investment cost in IT infrastructure, resource utilization remains a major concern in cloud based deployment and those systems are required to deliver, optimal performance. In this research, we propose the RESTful Economic-Aggregating Discovery Service (RECO-ADS) model to improve the cost effectiveness of resource use of the EPCIS system, which runs in the cloud. In the proposed model, we select the ADS model as the query traceability data approach. We design the internal and centralized traceability systems to comply with the EPCIS specification and Electronic Product Code Discovery Service (EPCDS) deployed to the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud business model. Moreover, we integrate the RESTful web service with the Interfaces of EPCIS and EPCDS traceability systems. The evaluation criteria to measure resource efficiency, including computing resources, data transfers, and response time, are provided. The RECO-ADS is compared with the conventional traceability models, Directory Service (DS), Query Relay (QR) and Aggregating Discovery Service (ADS), using the evaluation criteria. The comparison shows that the computing resources, which consist of the CPU and Memory percentages of EPCIS and EPCDS systems, are rather similar, whereas the total data transfer (kB/s) of RECO-ADS (661.97) was less than that of the DS (807.73), QR (794.80) and ADS (796.66) models by approximately 18.05%, 16.71%, and 16.91%, respectively. The response time of the RECO-ADS model was the shortest. Moreover, the design of the cache in the EPCDS repository in the RECO-ADS model yielded a reduced operational cost based on the performance evaluation. These findings improve on the cost-effective resource consumption in the IaaS cloud of not only the EPCIS system but also the EPCDS system. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Traceability systems help guarantee that products bought from stores exactly correspond to the description on the label. Traceability maps the journey of the food, from the store, throughout processing, right back to the original livestock. DNA can be used as a natural barcode, as it carries unique genetic information and can be used to identify individual animals. Genetic variability of markers was analysed with the aim of confirmation of the available set of 13 microsatellites. With the addition of five polymorphic markers, the probability of finding two animals sharing the same profile was, on average, four in ten million for the entire dataset. In Slovakia in 2015, 65 126 red deers were recorded. Using only the five extra polymorphic markers, it was possible to obtain a reliable individual genetic traceability system.

AB Legal requirements and consumer demands have motivated the development and application of traceability technology. Farming practices are the starting point of the agri-food supply chain and the destination of the agri-food traceability system (AFTS). The amount of resource information and the complexity of the production process of agri-food become the main obstacles to the wide application of AFTS. This study introduces an integrated machine-to-machine system that allows collecting field operation information automatically. This system includes an IoT-based integrated hardware system, a smart farm cloud (SFC) platform, and a mobile application, which accomplished the collection, upload, and storage of operation information. This system had been used in "BSD" organic apple orchard in Qixia, Shandong Province, China for about one year. The effectiveness of the system was evaluated by managing 270 apple trees in one plot of the orchard. Finally, a label with a QR code was successfully generated to provide consumers to query traceability information from a single tree to a fruit tray. This work was a background of a blockchain traceability system. Moreover, the future extendibility of the system was also discussed and prospected.

ID LABOR MIGRATION; FLUID SPACES; GOVERNANCE; WORK
AB This paper explores the question of what traceability systems mean for the labour situation of fishworkers; for whom and in what respects is traceability effective, and what impact do these systems have? The limited social criteria in fishery governance is a core reason for recurrent problems of extreme abuse of fishworkers around the world, including trafficking, forced labour and so called modern slavery. New traceability systems, thus, now include social criteria to advance sustainable fisheries globally. Drawing from a Thai fisheries reform case study, we analyse how the new labour traceability system emerges and is perceived by migrant fishworkers. We base our analysis on interviews, documents and two periods of fieldwork in Thailand. We argue that labour traceability is a double-edged sword. While fishworkers have seen major improvement in limiting extreme abuse, labour traceability has a downsides of state surveillance and costs passed onto workers. Moreover, traceability does not solve underlying problems regarding the complex formalization of migrant workers, working conditions on fishing boats, freedom to change employer or the everyday vulnerability of being a migrant worker. Thus, while labour traceability has promising policy relevance for the integration of labour rights into fisheries governance, it requires contextual underpinning in migrant circumstances.

AB Genetic traceability in the whole food supply chain is a reliable method to protect the integrity of Halal beef, but there is no available SNPs panel for the meat traceability of cattle breeds in China. This study aimed at developing a useful SNP panel for Halal beef traceability in the Chinese market. Fifty-nine SNPs markers belonging to 29 autosomes of bovine genome were tested in seven cattle breeds which were the Chinese main breed source of Halal beef. SNPs with minor allele frequencies less than 30% were excluded and a thirty-six highly informative SNPs panel had been selected. With the SNPs panel, the probability that one individual is incorrectly assigned ranges from 1.12 out of 10 (x15) to 3.38 out of 10 (x12), depending on the breed. In addition, twelve most polymorphic SNPs markers in the pooled animals were successfully used for meat traceability of Halal beef by meat-blood pairs. The selected thirty-six SNPs of panel could be employed to further guarantee the safety of Halal beef in the Chinese market. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nowadays it is important to know the origins of most products, not only for public health reasons, with regard to food products, but also because of the increasing people's awareness of environmental and social aspects, posing new challenges in the quality of products and their environmental impact. Food traceability information must be collected throughout the supply chain, and be registered on a platform external to all operators in that chain. This information must be available, not only to value chain operators and public health authorities, but also to end customers. One of the best ways to provide customers with this traceability information, in the places where they need to make a decision about which products to buy, is to add kiosks at the points of sale for those products. This article describes the design and architecture of a traceability platform for fish and fishery products, within the scope of the ValorMar R&D project, as well as the applications that supply the platform with traceability information, and a kiosk application for points of sale and a mobile app for final consumers, which will allow them to consult the traceability of fish and fishery products' lots.

AB Agricultural products are an important guarantee for human health. The supply chain of agricultural products as its carrier has always been a research hotspot in academia and business circles. Applying the Internet of Things and NFC technology to the agricultural product supply chain area will play an important role in the intelligent management and traceability of agricultural product supply chains. The intelligent management and traceability of agricultural products supply chain are the management of data information. How to collect, store, process, analyze, and visualize the data information during the flow of agricultural products from the source to the table is an important issue which needs urgent research. This paper proposes and validates the NFC technology assumption of the application value of agricultural product supply chain. The communication interface between the agricultural product supply chain data acquisition terminal and the collection terminal module and peripheral equipment based on BD, GSM, and NFC module is designed. The physical storage structure of the NFC tag is then planned, and the DES and RSA encryption algorithms of the NFC tag are implemented. According to the theory of Internet of Things, the traceability system of agricultural product supply chain is divided into four levels: physical layer, service layer, data layer, and application layer. The three major areas of enterprise management, user query, and government supervision are designed to trace the information flow and system. Finally, this paper analyzes the hardware resources needed for the traceability system of agricultural product supply chain and uses the resources of the cooperative supply chain enterprise to implement the system application and deployment. The experiment verifies that the real-time traceability monitoring system for agricultural product supply chain proposed in this paper is effective in practical application.

AB In this study, consumers' willingness to pay for farming, slaughter and processing, distribution and marketing, and government certification information was investigated in Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, China using an experimental auction and real choice experiment based on incentive compatibility of the nonhypothetical elicitation method. No significant differences in consumers' willingness to pay were revealed by the experimental auction and real choice experiment on the whole, and results from both nonhypothetical experimental methods demonstrated that consumers were willing to pay certain premiums for all four types of traceability information and had the highest willingness to pay for government certification information. These results indicate that consumers trust in pork safety protection under governmental supervision. Moreover, it was found that government certification information played a significant role in improving consumer utility, demonstrating that consumers paid close attention to safety risks in farming. Therefore, this study predicts that the introduction of governmental supervision into the pork traceability system and establishment of a system for collecting traceability information starting from the stage of pig farming will play important roles in meeting consumer demands for pork quality and safety, as well as promoting the development of traceable food policies.

ID DISCRIMINATION
AB Privacy protection in agricultural traceability has received more and more attention. Most of the existing methods only protect the original data information from the perspective of cryptography and ignore the availability of the protected information. In fact, after data is processed by cryptography, blockchain, and other technologies, it cannot be directly used for machine learning model training. Therefore, differential privacy has great potential value for privacy protection in agricultural traceability, which can enable data to participate in classification tasks under privacy protection. In this paper, we propose an integrated algorithm for agricultural traceability called Differentially Private XGBoost (DP-XGB), which can protect the privacy of the original data during the training process and obtain high model utility under the condition of a small sample size. We inject Gaussian noise into the gradient operator and Hesse operator of the original XGBoost and give the calculation method of the resulting privacy budget. Experiments show that our method can effectively obtain differential privacy guarantees and achieves very high classification accuracy when the noise is small.

AB The introduction of improved food traceability systems has aimed to restore consumer confidence in food safety and quality, in part by being able to provide consumers with more information about the origins of foods and food ingredients. However, little is known about consumers' opinions and beliefs associated with traceability, nor their preferences for information provision. In the current paper, consumer information needs and requirements regarding traceability are investigated. Semi-structured interviews with consumers in four European countries focused on the need for traceability, the preferred means of communication, labelling and bodies held responsible for traceability and dealing with fraud. Results show that there is a clear consumer need for varied information about food and the production processes involved. Rigorous and accountable traceability systems may assist in making such information available to consumers.

AB Compared with conventional identification methods, DNA-based genetic approaches such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and satellites are much more reliable for pig identification and meat traceability. In this study, multiallelic amplification fragments with multiple SNPs, incorporating the advantages of both SNPs and microsatellites, were explored for the first time for pig identification and meat traceability. Primer pairs for multiallelic fragments and their optimal SNPs were successfully selected and used for identification of individuals from Suzhong and Duroc populations. Meanwhile, the combined panel of the above mentioned primer pairs together with their optimal SNPs for Suzhong and/or Duroc pigs were validated for identification of the hybrids (SuzhongxDuroc). Therefore, we have successfully selected multiallelic amplification fragments with multiple SNPs to identify pigs and their meat samples from Suzhong, Duroc or their hybrids. Our study demonstrates that our method is more powerful for pig identification or meat traceability than SNPs or microsatellites.

AB Meat traceability is essential for meat safety and to solve adulteration issues. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are commonly used as a DNA marker and provide a way to trace meat and meat products. The high resolution melting method is a relatively cheap and fast method for detecting specific SNPs. In the present study, we selected 8 SNPs from the NCBI dbSNP database and tested their feasibility in blood or meat samples from 135 sheep reared in northwestern and eastern China. The results indicated that seven SNPs were suitable for meat traceability and the probability of 2 individuals having the same genotype was 1.85 out of 1000.

ID SUPPLY CHAIN; TECHNOLOGY; CHALLENGES; CLASSIFICATION
AB A framework combining the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain can help achieve system automation and credibility, and the corresponding technologies have been applied in many industries, especially in the area of agricultural product traceability. In particular, IoT devices (radio frequency identification (RFID), geographic information system (GIS), global positioning system (GPS), etc.) can automate the collection of information pertaining to the key aspects of traceability. The data are collected and input to the blockchain system for processing, storage, and query. A distributed, decentralized, and nontamperable blockchain can ensure the security of the data entering the system. However, IoT devices may generate abnormal data in the process of data collection. In this context, it is necessary to ensure the accuracy of the source data of the traceability system. Considering the whole-process traceability chain of agricultural products, this paper analyzes the whole-process information of a tea supply chain from planting to sales, constructs the system architecture and each function, and designs and implements a machine learning- (ML-) blockchain-IoT-based tea credible traceability system (MBITTS). Based on IoT technologies such as radio frequency identification (RFID) sensors, this article proposes a new method that combines blockchain and ML to enhance the accuracy of blockchain source data. In addition, system data storage and indexing methods and scanning and recovery mechanisms are proposed. Compared with the existing agricultural product (tea) traceability system based on blockchain, the introduction of the ML data verification mechanism can ensure the accuracy (up to 99%) of information on the chain. The proposed solution provides a basis to ensure the safety, reliability, and efficiency of agricultural traceability systems.

AB The agri-food sector in Romania is of particular importance for the market economy, referring to agriculture, food industry, commerce, and not ultimately the final consumer. Due to changes in consumer behavior of agri-food products, it is increasingly desirable to know the food traceability, the concept from farm to fork being constantly developing. In the context of ensuring food security, it is important to have an efficient monitoring of the food route in order to keep it fresh. An important factor in this process is the new communication and information technologies, which are in continuous development especially from the applicative point of view. This paper aims to support the producers and suppliers of fresh agri-food products in order to improve management at the short supply chain by exemplifying some types of computer tools that can be used in their work. The conclusion was that GIS maps and GPS location enable the use to know where production is located and the storage conditions.

AB Two-dimensional Data Matrix (DM) barcode printed on a food-grade tracer to carry simulated identifying information about grain in a prospective grain traceability system was evaluated for its ruggedness on different formulations, coating materials, and order of coating and printing. The key factor in evaluating the tracers was their ability to be read with a code scanner after being removed from a batch of grain at any point in the grain supply chain. After printing, the tracers were measured for initial readability, subjected to ruggedness tests involving abrasion and impact and the effect of moisture conditioning, and measured for final readability. Fourteen treatments involving two tracer types (sugar-based and cellulose-based), two coating materials (edible shellac and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, or HPMC), and four coat print procedures were considered. One particular treatment performed very well, whereas most others did not, having either low initial readability rates or low final readability rates after they were subjected to ruggedness testing. The treatment of interest consisted of cellulose-based tracers, printed in DM code with food-grade ink, and coated with HPMC after printing. Initial readability of this treatment averaged 98%, and final readability after ruggedness testing ranged from 89 to 99%, depending on the ruggedness test applied. These readability rates are considered acceptable for intended application. Since barcode printing on information-carrying tracers was an essential part of requirements for implementing the proposed grain traceability system, most major tracing system and technological components are now available in prototype form for the next phase of research and development for practical application of the system in the grain supply chain.

AB With increasing concerns about food safety in many countries, product traceability has become an important risk-management tool. It enables the identification of possible sources of defective goods and facilitates the withdrawal and recall of affected products to protect consumers from foodborne diseases. However, it is troublesome for farmers to maintain the records required by high precision product fraceability during harvesting because traditional traceability systems usually involve human labor in paperwork or expenses for equipment purchase and installation; in either case, the resulting records are tedious. In this article, a fully automatic algorithm is proposed for efficiently generating product fraceability trees to visualize and store the full transport record of wheat from fields to elevators. Extending previous work on harvesting activity recognition via GPS tracks, this algorithm powers our fully automatic prototype product traceability system, APT3, and demonstrates great potential for tracing products solely with the GPS logs of the vehicles involved in harvest and transport. From the output traceability trees, the product yielded at any point in the field can be tracked all the way to the elevator where it was sold or stored by starting from the corresponding leaf node in the fraceability free and walking to the root of the free. Furthermore, each truckload of product unloaded at any destination elevator can be traced back to where the product was harvested by following the tree in the opposite direction. In this way, the fraceability records can be clearly visualized for farmers and easily used by other algorithms.

AB Consumers have become increasingly concerned about food safety due to numerous food scandals and incidents over the past two decades. Consequently, they demand to be informed of the processes involved along the food supply chain. Employing a traceability system, tracing food from 'farm to fork', has been embraced by the food industries and governments as an important tool to restore and increase consumers' confidence in food safety. However, there is limited research examining consumers' perceptions of, and confidence in, the food traceability system to fulfil the role of ensuring food safety. To bridge the knowledge gap, we conducted an online survey of 489 consumers from three major Australian cities. The results suggested that although participants had a great desire to know how their food was produced and handled, it was their understanding of, and confidence in, food traceability systems that strongly predicted their willingness to pay (WTP) for having their food traced. Participants also indicated that, in comparison to locally produced food products, it was more important to have imported food products traced. However, paradoxically, the information provided by the traceability system of imported food products was less trusted. The results highlight that, in order to use the food traceability system to gain consumer trust in food safety, it is critical to inform consumers how the system works to build their confidence in the system.

Seven stable isotope ratios (i.e. delta C-13, delta N-15, delta H-2, delta O-18, (87/86)sr, (207/206)pb and Pb-208/207) and 25 multielemental concentrations (Na, Ca, Fe, Zn, Rb, Ag, and Cd, etc.) were assayed and used to establish principal component analysis (PCA) and step-wise linear discriminant analysis (LDA) modeling to determine the rice's geographical origin. The prediction accuracies were cross-validated, and "blind sample" tests were all higher than 90.0% for rice samples from different production areas in China and 85.0% for rice imported from Southeast Asia, respectively. The high level of geographical traceability when combining stable isotope and multielement fingerprints with chemometric data-processing provides a promising tool to assure the origin of Chinese polished rice. This authentication method protects premium rice brands, combats commercial fraud, and quickly locates the origin of contaminated Cd rice to add verifiable food safety measures for consumers.

AB Radio frequency identification (RFID) and quick response (QR) codes are an effective way to identify traceable resource units (TRUs) and are widely applied in traceability systems. TRU transformation is common for things such as beef segmentation and wheat-flour packaging. The present study describes the development and testing of equipment for barcode-RFID bidirectional transformation to improve traceability by conserving identification association and information correspondence while transforming barcodes to RFID and vice versa. The framework of traceable bidirectional identification labels is based on comparing the features of RFID and barcodes and on analyzing TRU transformation. The proposed equipment includes a tactile industrial controller, a RFID-reader module, an embedded printing module, and a barcode scanning module. Furthermore, we develop the main functions of RFID-barcode conversion, bar-code-RFID conversion, and condition monitoring. The system is tested in field experiments based on two typical scenarios: beef segmentation and wheat-flour packaging. The average conversion success rate in RFID-barcode processing is 97%, and in barcode-RFID processing is 93.48%. The proposed equipment is more rapid than the reference method: 3.2 versus 8.7 s for RFID-barcode transformation and 10.5 versus 13.3 s for barcode-RFID transformation. In addition, the proposed equipment is less expensive than the conventional equipment. Test results indicate that continuous traceability is improved because identification association and information correspondence are conserved after TRU transformation.

AB Concern about food safety has become a hot topic, and numerous researchers have come up with various effective solutions. To ensure the safety of food and avoid financial loss, it is important to improve the safety of food information in addition to the quality of food. Additionally, protecting the privacy and security of food can increase food harvests from a technological perspective, reduce industrial pollution, mitigate environmental impacts, and obtain healthier and safer food. Therefore, food traceability is one of the most effective methods available. Collecting and analyzing key information on food traceability, as well as related technology needs, can improve the efficiency of the traceability chain and provide important insights for managers. Technology solutions, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Privacy Preservation (PP), and Blockchain (BC), are proposed for food monitoring, traceability, and analysis of collected data, as well as intelligent decision-making, to support the selection of the best solution. However, research on the integration of these technologies is still lacking, especially in the integration of PP with food traceability. To this end, the study provides a systematic review of the use of PP technology in food traceability and identifies the security needs at each stage of food traceability in terms of data flow and technology. Then, the work related to food safety traceability is fully discussed, particularly with regard to the benefits of PP integration. Finally, current developments in the limitations of food traceability are discussed, and some possible suggestions for the adoption of integrated technologies are made.

TI Vegan cheeses vs processed cheeses - traceability issues and monitoring
   countermeasures
SO BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE Food traceability; Risk assessment; Supply chain analysis; Vegan
   cheeses; Processed cheeses
AB Purpose The purpose of this study comes from the need of defining improved durability values and the realization of a good traceability management for selected vegan cheeses has suggested the comparison between a processed cheese and its analogous version without animal-origin raw materials. The durability should be studied at a well-defined temperature, probably agreed among the food producer and the food processor. In addition, the traceability system should consider many components and related suppliers. Design/methodology/approach A supply chain risk assessment analysis has been carried out with relation to two different products: an analogue cheese and a vegan cheese-like preparation. Raw materials and ingredients have been evaluated (production method and origin; geographical identification), with the aim of identifying simplified food. Findings An assessment of food supply networks has been carried out. In the first situation (analogue cheeses), the ingredient "cheeses" shows an important complexity: five suppliers with a related six-interconnection hub. On the other side, vegan cheeses are obtained from 11 ingredients (a challenging hub); four of them may be produced from 2-5 components of different origin (five total hubs). Tested processed cheeses are represented by means of a linear food supply network with two hubs (cheeses and "arrival" show degrees 6 and 9, respectively). Networks concerning vegan cheeses include five different hubs: four complex raw materials (degree: 2, 3, 4 and 5) and the "arrival" step (degree: 12). Originality/value The information load of vegan cheeses (two hubs, degrees >> average degree) appears high if compared with processed cheeses (two hubs), although the complexity of networks appears similar. Vegan cheeses may seem technologically simpler than processed cheeses and be sometimes questioned because of important traceability issues. Adequate traceability countermeasures in terms of preventive monitoring actions should be recommended when speaking of vegan cheeses. Anyway, a centralized manager would be always required.

AB The current study assessed the perceived value of food traceability in modern society by young consumers. After experiencing numerous recalls and food safety-related incidences, consumers are increasingly aware of the tools available to mitigate risks. Food traceability has been associated with food safety procedures for many years, but recent high-profile cases of food fraud around the world have given traceability a different strategic purpose. Focusing solely on dairy products, our survey results offer a glimpse of consumer perceptions of traceability as a means to preserve food integrity and authenticity. This study explored the various influences that market-oriented traceability has had on dairy consumers. For example, results show that if the dairy sector could guarantee that their product is in fact organic, 53.8% of respondents who often purchase organic milk would consider always purchasing traceable organic milk. This research produced a quantitative set of information related to the perceived value of food traceability, which could be useful for the creation and development of improved guidelines and better education for consumers. We discuss limitations and suggest areas for new research.

AB Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) has gained popularity in the wine sector due to its simplicity and ability to provide a wine's fingerprint. For this reason, it is often used for authentication and traceability purposes with more than satisfactory results. In this review, an outline of the reasons why authenticity and traceability are important to the wine sector is given, along with a brief overview of the analytical methods used for their attainment; statistical issues and compounds, on which authentication usually is based, are discussed. Moreover, insight on the mode of action of FT-IR is given, along with successful examples from its use in different areas of interest for classification. Finally, prospects and challenges for suggested future research are given. For more accurate and effective analyses, the construction of a large database consisting of wines from different regions, varieties and winemaking protocols is suggested.

AB The aquaculture sector is among the most significant and fastest-growing sectors of the global agrifood system. The production of aquaculture is not only increasingly important as a primary protein source to feed the world's population, but also of enormous importance as a trade good in global commerce. However, the industry faces many challenges to meet global demands including the over-exploited natural stocks, global warming, pollution, perishability, widespread food frauds, and food-borne diseases. A major requirement to meet the increasing demand for seafood is seafood security and safety. To ensure the security and safety of seafood, a variety of regulations and techniques have been developed. However, the current techniques have several limitations, such as not being able to provide reliable information with regard to the origin of farmed specimens, the instability of the methods, and the lack of any historical records for the food. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a traceability technique that could record the history of seafood from sea to table. This article provides an overview of the current regulations and traceability techniques to ensure the safety and security of seafoods. We suggest that the PCR-DGGE technique is a viable method to meet both traceability and safety requirements for seafoods at the same time.

TI Data modeling to facilitate internal traceability at a grain elevator

AB Data management in food supply chains to facilitate product traceability has gained importance in recent years. This paper presents a relational database model to facilitate internal traceability at a grain elevator, which is one of the first nodes in a food supply chain. This approach for modeling traceability information in bulk food supply chains has not been studied in past. At an elevator, grain lots (inbound deliveries) are blended to meet buyer specifications, and individual lot identity is not maintained. As a result, an outbound shipment to a customer likely contains grain from many different sources. In a food safety related emergency, tracing the source of a problem or tracking other affected shipments would be nearly impossible. An efficient internal data management system could mitigate these problems by recording all grain lot transformations/activities, including movement, aggregation, segregation, and destruction as well as supplier and customer information. In this paper, a relational database management system is proposed that stores all necessary information, including product and quality information, related to the grain lots in order to enable product traceability. The system can be queried to retrieve information related to incoming, internal and outgoing lots and to retrieve information that connects the individual incoming grain lots to an outgoing shipment. Furthermore, this system can be used both to trace back to the source of a given lot and to track information about previously shipped lots forward. In addition to traceability application, the information stored in this database provides a comprehensive dataset for many applications including mass flow optimization, resource optimization and improved operational efficiency of the grain elevator.

AB The traceability of foodstuffs is now a relevant aspect of the food market. Scientific research has been devoted to addressing this issue by developing analytical protocols in order to find the link between soil and food items. In this view, chemical parameters that can act as soil markers are being sought. In this work, the role of rare earth elements (REEs) as geochemical markers in the traceability of red wine is discussed. The REE distribution in samples from each step of the wine making process of Primitivo wine (produced in Southern Italy) was determined using the highly sensitive inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) technique. Samples analyzed include grapes, must, and wine samples after every step in the vinification process. The resulting data were compared to the REE distribution in the soil, revealing that the soil fingerprint is maintained in the intermediate products up to and including grape must. Fractionation occurs thereafter as a consequence of further external interventions, which tends to modify the REE profile.

AB At the beginning of the milk manufacturing process, a refrigerated bulk tank lorry is in charge of collecting milk from dairy farms in the area within a few hours. In this process, a milk sample is also collected at every farm. At the end of the collection the milk contained in the tank is analyzed. The problems appear when the analysis reveals the presence of forbidden substances at levels above stated thresholds in the milk tank but not in any of the samples; this is mainly due to the extremely low levels that are being considered for some substances and the way in which they rapidly deteriorate at high temperatures. Therefore, all samples must be kept in optimum - temperature controlled - conditions during transportation to ensure reliable results in the laboratory. In this paper, a novelty solution for the tracking and tracing of milk samples is presented. This solution includes a customized and automated cooler for carrying samples, a smart sensor inside the cooler saving the data collected during the process, and an USB sticker to transfer the collected data to a computer for further analysis. Several technologies have been combined to register and trace milk samples on their trip from farm to laboratory: microcontrollers, sensors, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and Global Positioning System (GPS). Hardware and software prototypes have been successfully developed and tested in real vehicle case studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Authenticity and origin tracing of animal-derived food are particularly necessary due to various kinds of food fraud such as adulteration, counterfeiting, substitution and intentional mislabeling. This review focuses on the current research status of animal-derived food from the aspects of geographical origin, feeding ingredients and systems, adulteration of substitutes, and physical and chemical properties. The methods and statistical models involved in the research and their advantages and disadvantages are summarized. Stable isotope ratio analysis and element analysis are the most extensive used geographical traceability techniques. Spectroscopic techniques have the advantages of quick response, low cost and non-destructiveness. Instrument technology combined with chemometrics is the key method for origin traceability and authenticity of animal-derived food. In addition, there is a new trend of origin traceability by analyzing inedible parts of animal-derived food. This review intends to give a broad but comprehensive understanding in authenticity and geographical origin traceability of animal -derived food.

AB Microsatellite markers have been shown to be a useful tool in individual identification and meat traceability. Aiming at developing a genetic tracing system for beef cattle breeds in the Chinese market, this study identified a set of 16 specific microsatellite markers within six breeds, including Japanese Black, Anduo yak, Limousin, Jiaxian Red, Nanyang Yellow and Luxi Yellow. A total of 180 alleles have been detected with an average number of 11.2 per locus, and the average polymorphism information content (PIC) is 0.7696 for all loci. The 16-loci set could successfully distinguish all the individuals of the six breeds. When the six most polymorphic markers were chosen for each breed, the matching probability (MP) value was found to be about seven in one million, excluding the extremely high value in Limousin. As the number of markers increased, the MP value was gradually lowered, and the accuracy was also enhanced. Meanwhile, the traceability validation test was conducted with the seven most polymorphic markers (ETH10, ETH225, ILSTS006, INRA032, INRA035, INRA037 and TGLA122), the conforming probabilities of genotypes for 28 blood and corresponding tissue samples were 100%. The results of this study could partly prevent the food fraud incidence in the Chinese market, and they also showed further evidence in the applications of genetic markers to meat traceability based on animal identification to ensure food safety.

AB 'Nebbiolo' is a well-known grapevine variety used to produce prestigious monovarietal Italian red wines. Genetic traceability is an important tool used to protect the authenticity of high-quality wines. SNP-based assays are an effective method to reach this aim in wines, but several issues have been reported for the authentication of commercial wines. In this study, the impact of the most common commercial additives and processing aids used in winemaking was analysed in `Nebbiolo' wine using SNP-based traceability. Gelatine and bentonite had the strongest impact on the turbidity, colour and phenolic composition of wines and on residual grapevine DNA. The DNA reduction associated with the use of bentonite and gelatine (>99% compared to the untreated control) caused issues in the SNP-based assay, especially when the DNA concentration was below 0.5 pg/mL of wine. This study contributed to explaining the causes of the reduced varietal identification efficiency in commercial wines.

Digital technologies present opportunities and new methods for identifying and tracking animals, collecting more data, integrating communication flows, sharing data securely in supply chains, and analysing data to inform decisions and predict outcomes. Together, these technologies drive more efficient, productive and traceable supply chains, which can help to build more effective animal traceability systems. In addition, they can improve monitoring of, and response to, animal disease, food safety risks and food fraud risks; ensure compliance with animal health and food safety standards; simplify border procedures; facilitate trade with less friction; and raise consumer awareness. As the cost of these technologies decline and they become more accessible, the implementation of a digitally enabled animal traceability system will require an increase in supply chain capacity, improvements in digital infrastructure, and the development of a regulatory framework of standards and policies. Ensuring that these requirements are met will require strong commitment from governments, intergovernmental organisations and the wider animal health community.

AB Production areas influence the quality of highland barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), and fertilization levels may be associated with the origin traceability of highland barley. As the main object of the study, a collection of highland barley was planted in different areas in Tibet, China, to explore the effect of fertilizer on the quality and traceability of highland barley. We carried out field experiments with and without fertilizer treatment (using urea and diamine phosphate). Highland barley was distinguished by nutrient and mineral element contents in combination with chemometric methods. The results indicated that fertilizer treatment significantly affected some mineral element contents in highland barley and improved the accuracy of highland barley traceability. The combination of nutrients and mineral elements could distinguish highland barley from those raised in other areas due to influence of growing environment. P, K, Fe, and Cu provided a great contribution to the classification of highland barley. Thus, the combination of nutrients and mineral elements can be used as a powerful tool to track highland barley, indicating that fertilization treatment should be considered when tracing highland barley.

TI Traceability of Information Routing Based on Fuzzy Associative Memory
   Modelling in Fisheries Supply Chain
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FUZZY SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE Traceability; Fuzzy associative memory; Handling time
ID NEURAL-NETWORK; FOOD; DESIGN
AB Traceability is the ability to verify the history and location of a food product, thus providing information on each supply-chain actor, who the immediate supplier is, and to whom the product was sent. The information system approach has been used to manage and integrate all such information by collecting, storing, then retrieving data and information about the product from earlier stages of the production process. Besides documentation and information sharing, such traceability information systems can also support timely resolution of customer complaints. This paper presents modelling of routing and handling time prediction using a fuzzy associative memory (FAM) method. As a first response to customers, information about the time required to resolve an issue can be provided after the source of a product defect has been traced. With regards to handling, traceability can assist with several issues, e.g., product replacement, product recalls based on retrieval of the contact numbers of affected customers on a recall list , and inspections at each production unit to ensure food safety standards. Based on such activities, it is assumed that the handling time will be affected by the size of the product inventory that can be used to replace a defective product, the amount of product that must be recalled from the market, and the time required internally for the inspection process, which is set as the FAM input variable. A FAM is a set of fuzzy-set pairs (A, B) that maps an input vector fuzzy set A to an output vector fuzzy set B. Our experiments show that, from such a FAM formulation, one can obtain 27 rules. The FAM will encode a fuzzy-set pair (A, B) to obtain matrix memories, denoted by M. As the prediction result, the matrix B can be obtained from the computational matrix A and the matrix M; For instance, in case of a contamination incident in a fish product with inventory conditions of as much as 4 tonnes, the product recall amounts to 21 tonnes and the inspection will take 25 h, while the results of the computational experiment show that the total handling time for this case will be 66 h with low error rates.

AB This study presents a system based on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) biosensor and internet of things (IoT) for pesticide residues detection and agricultural products traceability. The system we presented based on AChE biosensor and IoT aims to extend the benefits of the pesticide residues detection date-remote control ability, data processing and sharing, agricultural products traceability and so on-to detection devices (hypogynous computer) in detection locations. These detection data got from detection devices were further aggregated, processed and analyzed by Epigynous computer in order to extract useful information(detection time, production places, detection samples, pesticide residues values, detection inspector) which were effective in protecting the quality and safety of agricultural products. In this study, the code of useful information was used in form of QR code, tracing and retracing the safety of agricultural products was achieved efficiently and reliably. In view of above, we design and implement a system based on AChE biosensor and IoT for pesticide residues detection and agricultural products traceability. It provides safe fruit and vegetable information for consumer, and lay foundation for the traceability of agricultural product.

AB The complexity of a supply chain makes product safety or quality issues extremely difficult to track, especially for the basic agricultural food supply chains of people's daily diets. The existing agricultural food supply chains present several major problems, such as numerous participants, inconvenient communication caused by long supply chain cycles, data distrust between participants and the centralized system. The emergence of blockchain technology effectively solves the pain-point problem existing in the traceability system of agricultural food supply chains. This paper proposes a framework based on the consortium and smart contracts to track and trace the workflow of agricultural food supply chains, implement traceability and shareability of supply chains, and break down the information islands between enterprises as much as possible to eliminate the need for the central institutions and agencies and improve the integrity of the transaction records, reliability and security. At the same time, farmers record details of the environment and crop growth data in the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and store file IPFS hashes in smart contracts, which not only increases data security but also alleviates the blockchain storage explosion problem. This framework has been applied in Shanwei Lvfengyuan Modern Agricultural Development Co., Ltd. Although there are still many defects, the framework has successfully realized functions such as disintermediation and tracing of agricultural product information through QR codes. Thus, the framework proposed in this paper is of great significance and reference value for enterprises to ensure product quality and safety traceability.

AB Hides are an important co-product of the meat processing industry which are further used in leather production. However, there is a lack of automated traceability systems in this industry. A traceability system can improve data capture and information exchange between the stakeholders of a hide supply chain which can further improve supply chain coordination. Such a system can be used to provide important feedback to the producers about handling practices on the farm as well as provide relevant product information to the customers. A traceability system for the Norwegian hides supply chain is proposed in this paper. Various data capture technologies including RFID, dot peening and laser engraving were tested in a pilot setting. Pilot tests showed that traceability from the farm to the hide processor is possible using the RFID enabled hide tags up to the tanning process. If the machine-readable requirement is not necessary, laser engraving can be used for traceability covering the entire supply chain including the tanning process. Costs and benefits of proposed technologies are presented. Security concerns related to the use of RFID tags are also discussed.

AB Select cultivars of table olives have more desirable traits and a higher economic value. There are suspected issues with cultivar mislabeling and traceability in the supply chain. Here, we describe a method to identify cultivars by genotyping of processed olives. DNA was extracted from leaves and California-style olives of seven commonly packed cultivars. Processed olive fruits yielded relatively low DNA concentrations (0.04-0.86 mu g/g), and extracts had more impurities compared with leaves. From 15 candidate SSRs, five markers showing the highest number of unique allele combinations and discriminatory power were selected. These SSRs were successfully amplified and analyzed in all cultivars of olives except one. When directly comparing any two cultivars, different allele combinations were typically present for at least four of the five SSRs. Microsatellite analysis shows potential as a simple yet robust diagnostic tool. The method can be expanded to include other cultivars, styles of table olives, and potentially other processed plant-based foods.

AB Microsatellite markers are reliable and cheap method for studying diversity among animal breeds. They are widely used for separation of related animal breeds on genetic level. When used in food industry, they have great potential to be used for authentication of animal food products. We are aiming to explore the variability of alleles in selected markers in modeled F1 generation of Slovak breeds of chicken. We want to compare, if previously proposed traceability model is relevant for next generation of chickens or it is limited to one, parental, generation. Our analysis was based on 7 selected microsatellite markers. We modeled genotypes of 42 F1 generation individuals of Oravka tawny and 42 of Oravka white, derived from 1 rooster and 7 chickens from each breed. In our study, we used PCoA analysis and neighbor joining (NJ) analysis. With usage of both analyzes, we proved, that both generations are unique and genetic distance between individuals of different color breed are wide enough. We proved, that we only need to genotype the parental generation of both Oravka chicken tawny and white breeds. After creating F1 generation, we are reliably able to separate those populations. There is no need to genotype whole F1 generation. This provide huge financial benefits. Furthermore, we are able to trace and authenticate whole F1 production generation.

AB BACKGROUND Traditional methods of evaluating herbs were mainly based on chromatographic techniques. They usually included tedious sample preparation procedures, taking tens of minutes to hours, and consume solvents as well as standards for external calibration. In this paper, the feasibility of employing a fluorescence fingerprint coupled with multi-way chemometrics analysis for quality evaluation and traceability of Bletilla striata were investigated. RESULTS Relative concentrations of four markers presented in B. striata were determined by using a four-component self-weighted alternating trilinear decomposition (SWATLD) model. These markers could be applied to accurate classification and quality control of B. striata samples from different regions. Furthermore, multiway principal component analysis, multilinear partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), unfolded PLS-DA, and SWATLD-PLS-DA models were applied to classify the B. striata samples according to their geographic origins. Consistent results were obtained showing that B. striata samples could be successfully grouped based on their geographical origins and quality. CONCLUSION Our results revealed that the method developed can be used for quality evaluation and traceability of B. striata. Compared with the chromatographic methods, the method employed in this study was more convenient, simpler, and more sensitive. (c) 2018 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Amid stringent traceability requirements and a nearly 14-year ban, the U.S. beef industry is rebuilding its market presence in China. Blockchain technology offers a responsive means of meeting Chinese import traceability requirements while also addressing consumers' food safety concerns. We evaluate Chinese demand for U.S. beef and blockchain-based traceability and find that a sizeable segment of the market (37%) is willing to pay a premium for U.S. beef that is traceable using blockchains. Results indicate that investments in traceability systems that utilize blockchain technology may be an effective way for producers to capture a significant market share in China.

AB China is establishing a Food Traceability System (FTS), but the policy implementation is behind most developed countries. The lack of FTS awareness may be a factor contributing to farming practices that are not consistent with FTS policies. Furthermore, the structure of an agri-food supply chain is a factor influencing farms' compliance with FTS. The present study focuses on pesticide residue control and traceability issues in one of the largest tea production areas in China. It aims to examine the effect of FTS awareness and related policies on tea farms' operations as well as the influences of supply chain structure on the effects of policy awareness.
   In this study the data were collected from Fujian province, which is a traditional, major tea-growing region in China with 18% of national production. Farms were recruited through a Stratified Sampling procedure that included 428 participating farms from the four largest tea-producing counties in Fujian. The participating farms answered questions regarding their awareness of FTS and related policies as well as the supply chain structure. The participants also reported their agricultural record-keeping practices related to pesticide residue control, including pesticide use, pesticide residue test, and sales record.
   The results reveal that farm owners' or operators' FTS awareness has a positive effect on pesticide use and sales record-keeping practice, and the supply chain structure importantly moderates the effects of policy awareness on operations related to pesticide residue control. Compared to independent growers, tea farms within an integrated supply chain were more likely to take pesticide residue tests or keep sales records. The results suggest that increasing FTS awareness among tea growers would be crucial to establish a safe and traceable system. Furthermore, governments need to take the supply chain structure into account.

AB With the globalisation of agro-product markets and convenient transportation of food across countries and continents, the potential for distribution of mis-labelled products increases accordingly, highlighting the need for measures to identify the origin of food. High quality food with identified geographic origin is a concern not only for consumers, but also for agriculture farmers, retailers and administrative authorities. Currently, stable isotope ratio analysis in combination with other chemical methods gradually becomes a promising approach for agro-product authenticity and traceability. In the last five years, a growing number of research papers have been published on tracing agro-products by stable isotope ratio analysis and techniques combining with other instruments. In these reports, the global variety of stable isotope compositions has been investigated, including light elements such as C, N, H, O and S, and heavy isotopes variation such as Sr and B. Several factors also have been considered, including the latitude, altitude, evaporation and climate conditions. In the present paper, an overview is provided on the authenticity and traceability of the agro-products from both animal and plant sources by stable isotope ratio analysis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB As China's agricultural output has improved, the national and local monitoring system of agricultural product safety has become much better, and monitoring standards have become increasingly strict. Despite this, there are agricultural product safety incidents which have caused consumer panic. One way to address this is by properly establishing tracking systems so that agricultural product logistics in China can be tracked and monitored. We explored this research objective with agricultural traceability and security in mind. One option that could be considered is the blockchain technology. Blockchain could also be used to ascertain the provenance of agricultural products to increase the quality and safety of the Chinese agricultural supply chain. In this context, this research converged on big data and technology, platforms and other means for product quality and safety of agricultural products traceability. In order to verify the accuracy of these three convergence, regression analysis were used to construct five models for verification of three hypothesis. The results show that based on "Internet+", using big data, big technology and big platform can significantly increase the accuracy of agricultural products traceability system hence improve consumer acceptance of the safety of agricultural products.

AB Traceability consists of documented proof of the identity of a product and the responsibilities involved in the production chain 'from the field to the consumer's table'. Traceability is based on documenting material balances through discrete batch monitoring and management. Four steps are described as the basic frame of any possible traceability scheme of extra-virgin olive oil: harvesting batches, milling batches, storage batches and packaging batches. The role of analytical fingerprinting of batches is a complementary, not an alternative, tool for extra-virgin olive oil traceability.

AB Food authenticity and traceability and climate change are key scientific issues that must be addressed in response to the food crisis in 2050. Lanmaoa asiatica mushroom is an expensive and nutritious fungi-based diets resource, it is necessary to identify its geographical origin and explore the impact of the climate on it. Thus, the purpose of this study is to establish a fast and accurate geographical traceability model based on L. asiatica mushrooms chemical information collected by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technology, and screen out key climate variables by competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) algorithm. Based on the NIRS information of L. asiatica mushrooms, two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS) images were generated and a residual neural network (ResNet) image recognition model was established to identify the geographical origin of L. asiatica mushrooms. The accuracy of training set and test set of ResNet model is 100%, and the loss value is 0.052, which indicates that the model is effective. In addition, the CARS algorithm was used to select the feature variables from 105 climate variables. Four important variables (February, March, and April precipitation and January minimum temperature) related to NIRS difference of L. asiatica mushroom were obtained by CARS algorithm. The results can provide a fast and accurate method for food authenticity and traceability research, and provide an innovative idea for screening key climate factors.

AB The consumer environment determines consumers' buying behavior and product preferences, and understanding these factors allows businesses in the industry to identify market demands. In view of the different contexts, Spain and Brazil, there are differences in the consumption of beef, in the production and the regulatory process concerning beef, and in particular the traceability system. The traceability system is mandatory in Spain and voluntary in Brazil. From these prerogatives, this cross-cultural study carried out through a self-administered questionnaire with 2132 Spanish and Brazilian beef buyers/consumers, aimed at comparing and understanding the familiarity with the bovine traceability system and traceability information of the label as a food security indicator. It is concluded that traceability information is well received by consumers as an attribute of credibility, and consumers are interested in ensuring that the item they buy is of known and reliable origin. But more incentives may help clarify the advantages of purchasing food with certified traceability, making it more effective for consumers to use this knowledge.

AB Blockchain has become a modern technology that can enhance the traceability of products and services, which is particularly relevant to agri-food supply chains. This paper reviews studies on blockchain technology applications to the agri-food supply chain system and food industry, and discusses potential adaptation of blockchain technology for livestock-based products with a focus on the ASEAN Region and Thailand. A comprehensive method for reviewing the literature was adopted, and this paper encompasses stakeholders along the supply chain of livestock-based products to understand the prospect of applying blockchain technology to the sector. It was found that while blockchain technology is potentially sustainable and worthy of applications, there remain various limitations and complications toward adoption, such as the low awareness among stakeholders, the weak sector-wide coordination, and the lack of capacity in primary suppliers. Potential benefits and implications of blockchain technology for the food industry have yet to be widely understood, especially in the ASEAN. These findings would call for coordinated support from both the governments and the private sector, especially to raise awareness of the technology, reinforce sector-wide coordination, and develop skills required for adoption.

AB Origin traceability is an important step to control the nutritional and pharmacological quality of food products. Boletus edulis mushroom is a well-known food resource in the world. Its nutritional and medicinal properties are drastically varied depending on geographical origins. In this study, three sensor systems (inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrophotometer (ICP-AES), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) and Fourier transform mid-infrared spectroscopy (FT-MIR)) were applied for the origin traceability of 184 mushroom samples (caps and stipes) in combination with chemometrics. The difference between cap and stipe was clearly illustrated based on a single sensor technique, respectively. Feature variables from three instruments were used for origin traceability. Two supervised classification methods, partial least square discriminant analysis (FLS-DA) and grid search support vector machine (GS-SVM), were applied to develop mathematical models. Two steps (internal cross-validation and external prediction for unknown samples) were used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. The result is satisfactory with high accuracies ranging from 90.625% to 100%. These models also have an excellent generalization ability with the optimal parameters. Based on the combination of three sensory systems, our study provides a multi-sensory and comprehensive origin traceability of B. edulis mushrooms.

AB The demand for animal proteins, especially from pork and poultry, is projected to increase significantly due to rapid growth in population and underlying socio-economic conditions. Livestock rearing using conventional feed ingredients is becoming challenging due to climate change and several other factors, thereby suggesting the need for alternative, viable and sustainable animal feed sources. The use of black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) (Hermetia illucens) as a component in animal feed is a promising candidate due to their ability to valorise different organic waste streams. The nutrient composition of BSFL reared on organic waste streams is also comparable to that of several conventional animal feed ingredients and varies depending upon the feed, rearing conditions, and the morphological stage of the larvae. The identification of organic waste is of importance as it can determine not only the composition but also the safety issues of BSFL as an animal feed ingredient. The objective of this study was to determine the ability of near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to trace the food waste used to grow BSFL. Samples of BSFL (5th and 6th instar BSFL; n = 50) obtained from a commercial production facility were analysed using NIR spectroscopy. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was employed to develop the models. The outcomes of this study revealed that NIR spectroscopy could distinguish different larval instars and suggested the importance of larval instars in developing calibration models for traceability applications. The developed PLS-DA model could predict the feed source used for rearing the 5th instar larvae (R-2 value: 0.89) and 6th instar pre-pupae (R-2 value: 0.91). This suggests that NIR spectroscopy could be used as a non-invasive traceability tool for BSFL and to assist in selecting the suitable time frame for larvae harvesting in commercial facilities.

AB A traceability system can quickly and accurately query product supply chain circulation information. It is difficult to obtain processing information and achieve sharing due to the big data, long duration, large amount of equipment and scattered and easily lost processing information. In tracing the application of the case-based reasoning (CBR) to product processing, we can solve the problem of establishing an accurate and complete mathematical model between the processing information and product quality defects by finding a target record in a large amount of historical data. The traceability model of ontology and CBR uses the web ontology language (OWL) for case representation to simplify the CBR framework for big data, classifies process data and standardizes information storage. A joint optimization algorithm based on the genetic algorithm (GA) and CBR is proposed to establish an optimization model of process traceability, which is applied to case retrieval and reuse. This algorithm optimizes the genetic operator by combining the optimal preservation strategy and roulette selection method and uses an exponential-scale transformation method to stretch the fitness function. The experiments show that the optimized traceability model can infer information from garbled codes, wrong codes and missing messages to quickly determine the problematic products, thus effectively improving the traceability accuracy of product processing.

AB This paper aimed to identify the determinants of beef traceability adoption at farm level in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. A sample survey of 32 farmers who adopted the European Union certified traceability and 52 other farmers who did not adopt traceability provided data to test hypotheses on determinant factors. Three binomial logit models were used in the analysis. Results suggested that capital-intensive livestock production system, high scale production, access to specialized information and high level of human and social capital play significant role in the adoption decision.

AB The traceability of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) could guarantee the authenticity of the product and the protection of the consumer if it is part of a system able to certify the traceability information. The purpose of this paper was to propose and apply a complete electronic traceability prototype along the entire EVOO production chain of a small Italian farm and to verify its economic sustainability. The full traceability of the EVOO extracted from 33 olive trees from three different cultivars (Carboncella, Frantoio and Leccino) was considered. The technological traceability system (TTS; infotracing) consists of several open source devices (based on radio frequency identification (RFID) and QR code technologies) able to track the EVOO from the standing olive tree to the final consumer. The infotracing system was composed of a dedicated open source app and was designed for easy blockchain integration. In addition, an economic analysis of the proposed TTS, with reference to the semi-mechanized olive harvesting process, was conducted. The results showed that the incidence of the TTS application on the whole production varies between 3% and 15.5%, (production from 5 to 60 kg tree(-1)). The application at the consortium level with mechanized harvesting is fully sustainable in economic terms. The proposed TTS could not only provide guarantees to the final consumer but could also direct the farmer towards precision farming management.

AB Traceability is key to ensure food quality and safety from farm to fork, yet high implementation costs and the complexity of the food supply chain pose challenges to its operation. Here we propose a mobile-based bidirectional tracing system for food products that integrates graph data and peer-to-peer architecture. Our system allows data synchronization to happen seamlessly between all connected nodes, as data are gathered through market transactions and all related product information is concatenated by scanning 2D product barcodes. The system's decentralized and flexible structure favours stakeholder involvement and is applicable to various and dynamic food networks. By promoting resource efficiency and transparency of origin, production and distribution, the system ensures mesh surveillance and sheds light on complex food networks, ultimately contributing to the advancement of food research. Traceability is key to food quality and safety, but its wider implementation is hindered by high costs and technical complexity. A newly proposed mobile-based bidirectional system based on information concatenation through products' 2D barcodes offers an effective, cheaper and more flexible alternative.

AB This paper develops a moderated mediation model in which the interactive effects of food traceability and environmental dynamism on firm performance are mediated by the core capabilities (operating capabilities and marketing capabilities) in food supply chain context, by invoking the indirect view of organizational learning theory. Our hypotheses were tested using hierarchical regression and bootstrapping methods with a sample of 216 food manufacturing firms in China, and a survey-based, two-informant design was used to collect data. The results revealed that operating and marketing capabilities fully mediate the food traceability-performance link. In addition, environmental dynamism positively moderates the food traceability-core capabilities link. Moreover, it is found that operating and marketing capabilities transform the interactive impacts of environmental dynamism and food traceability into firm performance. Our study offers a fine-grained picture of the essential food traceability-performance link by revealing for the first time that there is an interactive impacts of food traceability and environmental dynamism on firm performance via core capabilities.

AB The origin of meat and meat products can be traced by verifying the identity of an offspring from its parents' genotypes. Although there are many microsatellite panels applicable to swine population, efficiency of parental testing decreases when the population consists of consanguineous animals. The aims of the present study were to develop a new microsatellite panel for traceability using parentage test in inbreed pig population and to assess how hybridization can influence the efficiency of parental testing. A new genotyping assay, based on 20-microsatellite assay, was performed in 304 individuals consisting of related and unrelated animals. The results showed that the microsatellites used in this study display high level of polymorphism ensuring a parentage assignment of 100%. This genotyping panel can be a useful tool to test a 'parent-to-fork' traceability system based on 20 microsatellite loci and can overcome technical limitations in inbreed population.

AB Logistics and storage is the main processing for agro-food supply chain. Because of disconnection information between the two processing, it is difficult to trace continuously. An intelligent conveyer belt provides an effective method to associate storage and logistics by QR code scanning and information recording. Improving the QR code readability in movement state is the core of implementing continuous chain traceability with this belt. In this paper, a intelligent conveyer belt including automatic conveyer unit, barcode scanning unit, fault remove unit and control display unit was designed. Four factors affected QR readability were selected and the value range was confirmed, which was reading distance, code size, coded characters and belt moving speed. Based on the belt, an Central Composite Inscribed (CCI) experiment of four factors with five levels was designed using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to obtain the optimal reading parameters. The result shows that the main factors of reading distance, belt moving speed and the interaction between reading distance and code size have the significant effect on QR code readability. Under the optimization condition of 141.45 mm reading distance, 34.58 mm code size, 100 bytes coded characters and 2.98 m/min belt moving speed, the average value of QR code readability was 95%. With the optimization parameters, the intelligent conveyer belt was used in an apple marketing enterprise. The result shows that the continuous traceability between storage and logistic can be implemented with the extended breadth, deepened depth and improved precision. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB As far as we known, recent studies on the origin of agricultural products rarely focus on the source of cities or counties even small-scale districts, but traceability of small-scale districts of food is the research trend and difficulty of future researches. The most commonly used methods of origin tracing researches are stable isotope and element technology, because these indicators are directly related to local geographical environment. However, when the region of traceability is very close, it is necessary to find new parameters to enhance the accuracy of traceability in small-scale districts. This study uses a combination of nutritional (amino acids) and geographical parameters (stable isotopes, elements) to trace the origin of milk from eleven districts located in five cities of Inner Mongolia. The results showed that the combination of nutritional (amino acids) and geographical parameters (stable isotopes, elements) was the best source tracing method.

AB Recent progress in IoT and software development has simplified data acquisition and immutability of information in the agri-food supply chain. In the last few years, several frameworks and applications were proposed to ensure traceability in the agri-food-sector using distributed ledger technologies (DLT) such as Blockchain technologies. Still, no other study has presented a Blockchain-based traceability platform with a lower impact on the environment and lower cost for each transaction sent by the supply chain. This article presents a traceability platform based on Green Blockchain with low energy consumption and costs savings applied to the Fontina PDO cheese supply chain, part of the project "Typicalp", funded by the European Union (EU). The proposed traceability system is based on Algorand Blockchain, which uses the Pure Proof-of-Stake mechanism of consensus that requires minimal computational power, is highly scalable and environmentally sustainable. In addition to the environmental and financial benefits, the developed traceability platform has made it possible to digitize the entire production chain, making the data immutable and available in real-time for Fontina consortium operators and final consumers.

AB BACKGROUNDOpuntia ficus-indica L. Miller fruits, particularly Ficodindia dell'Etna' of Biancavilla (POD), Fico d'india tradizionale di Roccapalumba' with protected brand and samples from an experimental field in Pezzolo (Sicily) were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry in order to determine the multi-element profile. A multivariate chemometric approach, specifically principal component analysis (PCA), was applied to individuate how mineral elements may represent a marker of geographic origin, which would be useful for traceability.
   RESULTSPCA has allowed us to verify that the geographical origin of prickly pear fruits is significantly influenced by trace element content, and the results found in Biancavilla PDO samples were linked to the geological composition of this volcanic areas. It was observed that two principal components accounted for 72.03% of the total variance in the data and, in more detail, PC1 explains 45.51% and PC2 26.52%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONThis study demonstrated that PCA is an integrated tool for the traceability of food products and, at the same time, a useful method of authentication of typical local fruits such as prickly pear. (c) 2017 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Currently, since the domestic and international food marketing on the safety supervision and traceability system is defective, as well as false labels used by agency, situation on the food safety is becoming more and more serious. In order to enhance food safety, it's essential to establish a fast and efficient geographical traceability method to protect the agricultural brand of Yunnan plateau. A total of 77 fruit bodies of Boletus tomentipes were collected from 8 geographical origins. Raw of ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were preprocessed by multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), standard normal variate (SNV), second derivative (2D), Savitzky-Golay (SG) smoothing. Based on pretreatment of UV and FUR spectra, low-level and mid-level data fusion strategy combined with partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and support vector machine (SVM) were used to identify Boletus in different regions. The results indicated that: (1) that the best pretreatment, was SNV+2D with highest (RY)-Y-2 (61. 58%) and Q(2) (95. 09%) for UV-Vis spectra, and MSC+2D with highest (RY)-Y-2 (50. 85%) and Q(2) (82. 16%) for FTIR spectra; (2) For UV-Vis, FTIR spectra, low-level and mid-level data fusion, the number of error samples in the classification of PLS-DA and SVM analysis were 24, 6, 2, 2, and 6, 1, 1, 0, respectively; (3) In the mid-level data fusion, the best classification of SVM with none error sample was better than that of the PLSDA with 2 error samples; (4) The classification of HCA analysis in the mid-level data fusion with 4 error samples had the better performance than that in the low-level data fusion with 1 error sample. In addition, HCA analysis of mid-level data fusion showed that the distance of samples collected from same area were longer than that collected from different sites. It indicated that the differences of samples collected from different sites in the same area were less than that collected from different regions. Those results indicated that mid-level data fusion combined with SVM model using UV-Vis and FTIR spectroscopy can accurately identify Boletus collected from different geographical origins. It will provide a new strategy on the research of geographical traceability of wild edible fungus.

AB Traceability technologies have great potential to improve sustainable performance in cold food supply chains by reducing food loss. In existing approaches, traceability technologies are selected either intuitively or through a random approach, that neither considers the trade-off between multiple cost-benefit technology criteria nor systematically translates user requirements for traceability systems into the selection process. This paper presents a hybrid approach combining the fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) with integer linear programming to select the optimum traceability technologies for improving sustainable performance in cold food supply chains. The proposed methodology is applied in four case studies utilising data collected from literature and expert interviews. The proposed approach can assist decision-makers, e.g., food business operators and technology companies, to identify what combination of technologies best suits a given food supply chain scenario and reduces food loss at minimum cost.

DE direct farm; production base; marketing chain; traceability; food safety
AB With the rapid growth of China's economy, rising demand for safety food has been accompanied by frequent food safety scandals. Given that China's farming is dominated by millions of small-scale farms, ensuring food safety is a major challenge facing the public and private sectors. The direct farm (DF) program, initiated in 2008, represents one of the government's major initiatives to modernize the distribution of fresh fruit and vegetables (FFV) and improve food safety. Under the DF program, participating national and international retailers are expected to establish more direct procurement relationships with farm communities. While it is often claimed that greater participation by retailers in the production and post-harvest processing implied the OF program will lead to improved quality, safety and traceability, systematic evidence remains elusive as existing studies are largely narrative, based on case studies, or theoretical inference. Little empirical evidence is available for a broader evaluation of the DF program. This paper aims to fill this gap by assessing the overall performance of a single retailer's OF experience with respect to the procurement and food safety of FFV. We use data from a survey of production managers of 35 OF production bases (PBs) spread across 11 provinces, 3 cities and 1 autonomous region in China. The results show a mixture of opportunities and challenges. On one hand, the DF program improves production practices and distribution channels of FFV produced on its PBs, thus facilitating the move of China's food system towards improved food safety compliance. On the other hand, significant heterogeneity in the traceability of food and the ability of OF to meet higher safety standards is evident both across major product categories and across household-operated vs. firm-operated PBs. The paper concludes with policy implications.

AB Barge, P., Gay, P., Merlino, V. and Tortia, C. 2013. Radio frequency identification technologies for livestock management and meat supply chain traceability. Can. J. Anim. Sci. 93: 23-33. Animal electronic identification could be exploited by farmers as an interesting opportunity to increase the efficiency of herd management and traceability. Although radio frequency identification (RFID) solutions for animal identification have already been envisaged, the integration of a RFID traceability system at farm level has to be carried out carefully, considering different aspects (farm type, number and species of animals, barn structure). The tag persistence on the animal after application, the tag-to-tag collisions in the case of many animals contemporarily present in the reading area of the same antenna and the barn layout play determinant roles in system reliability. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the RFID identification system performance and determine the best practice to apply these devices in livestock management. RFID systems were tested both in laboratory, on the farm and in slaughterhouses for the implementation of a traceability system with automatic animal data capture. For this purpose a complete system for animal identification and tracking, accomplishing regulatory compliance as well as supply chain management requirements, has been developed and is described in the paper. Results were encouraging for identification of calves both in farms and slaughterhouses, while in swine breeding, identification was critical for small piglets. In this case, the design of a RFID gate where tag-to-tag collisions are avoided should be envisaged.

AB Vanilla is a flavoring recovered from the cured beans of the orchid genus Vanilla. Vanilla xtahitensis is traditionally cultivated on the islands of French Polynesia, where vanilla vines were first introduced during the nineteenth century and, since the 1960s, have been introduced to other Pacific countries such as Papua New Guinea (PNG), cultivated and sold as "Tahitian vanilla," although both sensory properties and aspect are different. From an economic point of view, it is important to ensure V. xtahitensis traceability and to guarantee that the marketed product is part of the future protected designation of the origin "Tahitian vanilla" (PDO), currently in progress in French Polynesia. The application of metabolomics, allowing the detection and simultaneous analysis of hundreds or thousands of metabolites from different matrices, has recently gained high interest in food traceability. Here, metabolomics analysis of phenolic compounds profiles was successfully applied for the first time to V. xtahitensis to deepen our knowledge of vanilla metabolome, focusing on phenolics compounds, for traceability purposes. Phenolics were screened through a quadrupole-time-of-flightmass spectrometer coupled to a UHPLC liquid chromatography system, and 260 different compounds were clearly evidenced and subjected to different statistical analysis in order to enable the discrimination of the samples based on their origin. Eighty-eight and twenty three compounds, with a prevalence of flavonoids, resulted to be highly discriminant through ANOVA and Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structures Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) respectively. Volcano plot analysis and pairwise comparisons were carried out to determine those compounds, mainly responsible for the differences among samples as a consequence of either origin or cultivar. The samples from PNG were clearly different from the Tahitian samples that were further divided in two different groups based on the different phenolic patterns. Among the 260 compounds, metabolomics analysis enabled the detection of previously unreported phenolics in vanilla (such as flavonoids, lignans, stilbenes and other polyphenols).

AB Meat traceability based on molecular markers is exerting a great influence on food safety and will enhance its key role in the future. This study aimed to investigate and verify the polymorphism of 23 microsatellite markers and select the most suitable markers for individual identification and meat traceability of six swine breeds in the Chinese market. The mean polymorphism information content value of these 23 loci was 0.7851, and each locus exhibited high polymorphism in the pooled population. There were 10 loci showing good polymorphism in each breed, namely, Sw632, S0155, Sw2406, Sw830, Sw2525, Sw72, Sw2448, Sw911, Sw122 and CGA. When six highly polymorphic loci were combined, the match probability value for two random individual genotypes among the pig breeds (Beijing Black, Sanyuan and Taihu) was lower than 1.151 E-06. An increasing number of loci indicated a gradually decreasing match probability value and therefore enhanced traceability accuracy. The validation results of tracing 18 blood and corresponding meat samples based on five highly polymorphic loci (Sw2525, S0005, Sw0107, Sw911 and Sw857) were successful, with 100% conformation probability, which provided a foundation for establishing a traceability system for pork in the Chinese market.

ID PCR-DGGE; PHYSALIS FRUITS; ORIGIN; COMMUNITIES
AB Traceability is defined according to ISO 9000 as the ability to retrieve the origin and use of an article or an activity through a registered method. Its implementation in the timber industry is delayed because of limits of classical identification systems with regard to the nature of timber and features of the manufacturing process. One hypothesis of tracing the source of timber and its products is by analysing in a global way the microbial communities of timber and linking this analysis statistically to its geographical origin. We proposed a very innovative tool of fungi ecology, the polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), that was used to characterise the fungi flora of two tropical timbers species, teak and limbali from four countries: Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Central African Republic and French Polynesia. The aim was to show if there was statistical relation between the fungal communities of the timbers and their geographical origins. PCR-DGGE method is a new, simple and cheap traceability tool that can trace the original locations of timbers.

AB The quality and safety of aquatic products are increasingly important in China. In this study, we developed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based intelligent fish farming and tracking control system that includes a forecasting method that enables automatic water quality management and supports tracking the breeding and selling of freshwater fish. This system can assist fish farmers to intelligently control and manage fishpond water-quality treatment equipment and assist consumers in tracking and viewing historical farming process data using the QR code tag of an aquatic product, which can raise revenue of fish farmers and safeguard the food safety of consumers. We also propose a set of water-quality indicator forecasting methods for a fishpond intelligent management module that first detect and remove abnormal data using the local outlier factor (LOF) algorithm after compared with DBSCAN. Then, the key fishpond data are analysed, modelled and predicted using the model tree algorithm, allowing water-quality indicators to be addressed in advance and maintained within a safe range that complies with standards. The experiments verified that the mean values of the predicted data generated by the M5 model tree algorithm were closer to those of the training data than Cubist, RF, GBM algorithm, and strong correlations were found between the predicted data and the verification data. Moreover, the mean absolute errors of our method are small relative to the data means, indicating that the proposed method can effectively and accurately forecast water-quality indicators.

AB Assignment tests based on multilocus genotypes are becoming increasingly important to certify the origin of livestock products and assure food safety and authenticity. The potential of microsatellites for determining the origin of beef products among cattle breeds present in the Portuguese market with the Protected Denomination of Origin (PDO) was studied. Methodologies were used to establish the number of populations under study and to allocate individuals to their original population. The STRUCTURE program was used to perform the strictly Bayesian method and the GENECLASS 2 program was used to accomplish two types of assignment tests. The STRUCTURE program converged to 9 populations, precisely the number of populations under study. Regarding the individual allocation, the strictly Bayesian method implemented by the STRUCTURE program allowed 96% of correct allocations when running the program without the knowledge of the source populations and 98% when the STRUCTURE program was run knowing the source populations of the animals. In the assignment test performed by the GENECLASS 2, 95% and 97% of individuals were correctly allocated by the frequency and the Bayesian methods, respectively. These results show the potential feasibility for traceability scheme based on microsatellites. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SAFETY; INCENTIVES; REPUTATION; INDUSTRY; DESIGN; ISSUES; SYSTEM; PORK
AB This article addresses the sustainable traceability issue in the food supply chain from the sourcing perspective in which consumer willingness to pay for traceability is considered. There are two supplier types: traceable suppliers, which are costly but can carry a precise recall in food safety events, and non-traceable suppliers, which are less expensive but may suffer a higher cost in food safety events. A portion of consumers display traceability consciousness, and are willing to pay a premium for traceable food products. Four possible strategies in a transparent food supply chain and three sourcing strategies in a nontransparent food supply chain are identified and we determine when each strategy is optimal. We show that efforts to improve traceability that focus on consumers, by increasing their willingness to pay for traceability or expanding the portion of traceability consciousness consumers, may lead to an unintended consequence, such as a decrease in the provision of traceable food products. However, efforts that focus on revealing and penalizing the buyer always lead to a higher provision of traceable food products. We further find that efforts focusing on eliminating the information asymmetry may not be helpful for sustainable traceability in the food supply chain.

AB Wine quality and value largely depend on grape variety, which is of primary importance in wine identification. The aim of the present work was to enhance a wine DNA extraction protocol and, subsequently, grapevine variety identification. This enhanced method is an outcome from several previously developed extraction methods and effectively allows obtaining large amounts of high-quality DNA exhibiting an optimal 260/280 ratio. Grapevine variety DNA extracted from wine was amplifiable with a specific SSR primer. This procedure was applicable for monovarietal and older commercial red and white wines. The potential of this enhanced method relies on its use for traceability as part of protecting both consumer and producer interests.

AB Blockchain (BC) technology, defined as a shared information system to validate, secure, and permanently store transactions among multiple parties on a distributed ledger, presents many applications in agricultural and food industries. This study examines the application of BC in food traceability for beef in the United States using a choice experiment. Findings indicate that consumers value USDA certifications over BC traceability to guide their meat preferences. Our study suggests a number of industry implications, the most important of which suggests focusing business and consumer education on the value of product data, rather than on the value of the technologies that manage data.

AB The identification of a product, with its geographical origin, is a guaranty of the value of the foodstuff and protection from potential fraud. Extra virgin olive oil is produced or marketed as a single variety or a blend of two or more cultivars, often of different geographic origins. Therefore, to study a possible link between the soil and olive oil, we accounted crucial to analyse the behaviour of olive of different cultivars. We studied Rare Earth Elements (REE) amounts and their relationship to trace their distribution from soil to the olive pulp (Olea europea L.). The results obtained pointed out that the different cultivars of Olea did not drive significant differences in reciprocal ratios of REE in the uptake from the soil up to olive (except for Eu). However soil-plant Rare Earth relationships depend exclusively on the soil REE composition. This method can be the starting point to enforcing the laws, in fact, it is important to develop analytical methods to measure the authenticity of the samples, and to verify the geographical origin even when olive oil is blended.

AB Aquatic products are well received by customers from around the world. Quality and safety of aquatic products have attracted increasing attention, especially in emerging economies. Cased by actual aquatic products cold chain logistics, this article introduces the efforts for developing and evaluating the intelligent monitoring system for aquatic products (IMS-CS): an intelligent traceability system integrated wireless sensor network with statistical process control. Observations, interviews, literature review and experts' questionnaires were used for system requirement and knowledge acquisition; actual aquatic products cold chain logistics scenario was applied to evaluate and validate the performance of IMS-CS. The results show that that the IMS-CS could trace and monitor the real time temperature fluctuation and the quality of aquatic products, which improve the transparency of the cold chain logistics and enables more effective control of the traceability, quality and safety. The valuable suggestion indicates that the process was under medium risk level and had potential to be improved.
   Practical ApplicationsThe proposed method could be exploited widely by future researchers or practitioners in cold chain monitoring and traceability tasks.

AB Pork from Jeju black pig (population 3) and Berkshire (population B) has a unique market share in Korea because of their high meat quality. Due to the high demand of this pork, traceability of the pork to its origin is becoming an important part of the consumer demand. To examine the feasibility of such a system, we aim to provide basic genetic information of the two black pig populations and assess the possibility of genetically distinguishing between the two breeds. Muscle samples were collected from slaughter houses in Jeju Island and Namwon, Chonbuk province, Korea, for populations J and B, respectively. In total 800 Jeju black pigs and 351 Berkshires were genotyped at thirteen microsatellite (MS) markers. Analyses on the genetic diversity of the two populations were carried out in the programs MS toolkit and FSTAT. The population structure of the two breeds was determined by a Bayesian clustering method implemented in structure and by a phylogenetic analysis in Phylip. Population J exhibited higher mean number of alleles, expected heterozygosity and observed heterozygosity value, and polymorphism information content, compared to population B. The F-IS values of population J and population B were 0.03 and -0.005, respectively, indicating that little or no inbreeding has occurred. In addition, genetic structure analysis revealed the possibility of gene flow from population B to population J. The expected probability of identify value of the 13 MS markers was 9.87x10(-14) in population J, 3.17x10(-9) in population B, and 1.03x10(-12) in the two populations. The results of this study are useful in distinguishing between the two black pig breeds and can be used as a foundation for further development of DNA markers.

AB Quick response (QR) codes are two-dimensional (2D) barcodes that are widely used in food packaging. Moreover, scanning QR codes with mobile phones has become a convenient method to ensure product traceability. However, attaching QR codes to curved agro-food products to improve traceability effects and increase customer satisfaction presents a significant challenge. This paper reports an optimization method developed for curved surfaces that uses response surface methodology (RSM) analysis. The value ranges of the following four factors affecting QR readability were selected and analyzed: reading distance, ball diameter, code size, and coded characters. A central composite inscribed experiment using four factors with five levels was designed using RSM to obtain the optimal reading parameters, and experimental equipment was designed in-house. The results indicate the primary factors that significantly affect QR code readability are reading distance, ball diameter, the interactions between reading distance and code size, and the interactions between ball diameter and code size. Optimal parameters were obtained with the established model by using apples and melons. For actual experimental testing, two solutions for apples and one solution for melon were selected to determine the requisite average values for the parameters. Tests were performed using different mobile phones, including both iOS and Android platforms. An analysis of the results reveals only slight differences between simulated readability and actual readability for different fruits and mobile phone platforms.

AB In recent years, traceability systems have been developed as effective tools for improving the transparency of supply chains, thereby guaranteeing the quality and safety of food products. In this study, we proposed a cattle/beef supply chain traceability model and a traceability system based on radio frequency identification (RFID) technology and the EPCglobal network. First of all, the transformations of traceability units were defined and analyzed throughout the cattle/beef chain. Secondly, we described the internal and external traceability information acquisition, transformation, and transmission processes throughout the beef supply chain in detail, and explained a methodology for modeling traceability information using the electronic product code information service (EPCIS) framework. Then, the traceability system was implemented based on Fosstrak and FreePastry software packages, and animal ear tag code and electronic product code (EPC) were employed to identify traceability units. Finally, a cattle/beef supply chain included breeding business, slaughter and processing business, distribution business and sales outlet was used as a case study to evaluate the beef supply chain traceability system. The results demonstrated that the major advantages of the traceability system are the effective sharing of information among business and the gapless traceability of the cattle/beef supply chain.

Initially, FT-IR, UV spectra, and 14 elements of 312 samples obtained from 8 geographical origins were analyzed, respectively. Meanwhile, the principal components of three techniques were extracted by principal components analysis for data fusion. Finally, classification models were established in the basis of UV, FT-IR, elements, and fusion datasets combined with support vector machine (SVM). Compared with individual technology, data fusion of multi-technique can obviously promote the classification performance in SVM models for geographical origins traceability. Especially, the accuracy of prediction in SVM model by data fusion of three instruments was 99.04%, which was higher than single technique and data fusion of two spectroscopies techniques. This result indicated that data fusion strategy combined with SVM can provide high synergic effect for geographical origins traceability of Boletaceae mushrooms. The more information is fused, the better performance of the model is. This method may be applied for quality control and evaluation of analogous food.

AB Purity certified reference materials (CRMs) as the basis for traceability chains are play an important part in chemical metrology. In the context of supporting the implementation of monitoring plan of national quality and safety for agro-products, a project for development of fluoroquinolones purity CRMs was launched. These CRMs aimed to use as benchmark to assure the comparable and traceable measurement results of fluoroquinolone antibiotic residues in nationwide monitoring laboratories. In characterization, certified values were assigned by using mass balance (MB) and quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (qNMR). Homogeneity, stability and uncertainty evaluation were sufficiently studied. These fluoroquinolones purity CRMs including enrofloxacin (GBW(E)090817), ciprofloxacin (GBW(E)090818), norfloxacin (GBW09251), fleroxacin (GBW09249), lomefloxacin hydrochloride (GBW09250), ofloxacin (GBW(E)090822), danofloxacin mesylate (GBW(E)100475), sarafloxacin hydrochloride (GBW(E)0900960), pefloxacin mesylate (GBW09256) can be used to ensure the accurate and reliable measurement results acquired in the mandatory routine monitoring by providing a metrological traceability source for establishing comparability.

AB A robust whole chain traceability system can limit consumers' exposure to potentially hazardous foods, improve supply chain management, and add value to consumer products. However, fragmented supply chains present special challenges. In the beef industry, for example, producers have resisted participation in whole chain traceability because of high cost relative to value and concerns about disclosing proprietary information, among others. A multi-disciplinary team from universities, private firms, and a foundation has developed and tested a pilot proprietary centralized data whole chain traceability system that addresses many of these obstacles. This system would facilitate a precision agriculture approach to beef production and marketing. While the remaining challenges are serious, the benefits to society, consumers, and businesses from widespread adoption of whole-chain traceability systems are potentially large.

AB Chinese consumers prefer to purchase fish that have only recently been killed. The supplying of live fish is routinely delivered by water. However, the traditional transportation of live fish with water results in small volume of transportation and may cost prohibitive. Therefore, cold anesthetized waterless live fish transport is considered an alternative and promising strategy, since this is likely to demand less energy with large freight volume. This paper aims to develop an intelligent traceability platform based on HACCP system that integrates wireless monitoring and quality control models to improve the quality control and safety transparency in waterless fish transportation. In this research Chinese sturgeon is taken as experiment subjects for long-distance transportation. Oxygen change model is established as a life-sustained key factor by hybrid prediction method can optimize fish survivability. Survival prediction model is also designed for improvement of live delivery quality with minimum stress accumulation under precise temperature condition. For tracing function evaluation, the QR Code combined with existing EPC traceability technology enables users to expediently query and quickly trace the safety transport information from aquaculture to markets. To demonstrate the automatic monitoring and intelligent traceable management in this platform, sturgeon delivery experiments have been evaluated and analyzed. The results illustrate this system can reduce the potential risks, implement quality control with high survival results, and improve the live fish transport volume at low-costly. In brief, application of this smart platform will provide an effective, suitable technical reference for aquatic enterprises to follow, and help them to adjust the waterless transport techniques for the other types of aquatic products.

AB Temperature monitoring is the most critical requirement in the management of a cold products chain. A real-time temperature monitoring system can be useful in reducing losses in a cold food chain that occur due to product deterioration caused by fluctuating temperatures. A pilot test was conducted to evaluate the functionality of an EPCIS based online system for time-temperature monitoring and documenting traceability in a cold meat chain. The test was performed during transportation of chilled lamb products. The RFID based temperature sensors were used to record temperature of the product and ambient temperature inside the container at 10 min time intervals during transportation between processing plant and a distribution terminal 800 km away. The sensors communicated with the main unit installed in the truck and transmitted the data to an EPCIS based system which was accessible through a web interface. The temperature information was recorded as EPCIS events. The results of the application of EPCIS for online temperature monitoring are presented in this paper. Implementing a systematic EPCIS based cold chain monitoring tool can optimize the performance of the whole food supply chain by reducing losses caused by quality deterioration due to temperature variations.

AB Traceability systems are an important tool (1) for tracking, monitoring, and managing product flows through the supply chain for better efficiency and profitability of suppliers, and (2) to improve consumer confidence in the face of serious food safety incidents. After the global bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) crisis affected producers, consumers, trade, and the health status of animals and humans, new systems to help confirm the status of cattle products along the supply chain from farm to fork were implemented in many countries (Trautman et al. 2008). In this study, people's overall food safety beliefs are explored with the main objective of measuring the link between their food safety beliefs and their attitudes toward traceability. A comparison is made among English-speaking Canadians, French-speaking Canadians, and Japanese consumers. In the study, an Internet-based survey was used to collect data from nationally representative samples of the population in Canada-English (1275), Canada-French (343), and Japanese (1940) in the summer of 2009. Respondents' interests in traceability systems are clearly linked to their sense that the industry is primarily responsible for any food safety outbreaks. Moreover, it is clear that certain segments of the population in all samples feel strongly about the importance of farm to fork traceability in beef; thus, policymakers may wish to consider extending traceability beyond the point of slaughter as a way of encouraging beef sales in Canada.

AB Supply chain traceability is key to reduce food safety risks, since it allows problems to be traced to their sources. Moreover, it allows regulatory agencies to understand where risk is introduced into the supply chain, and offers a major disincentive for upstream agricultural businesses engaging in economically motivated adulteration. This paper focuses on the aquatic supply chain in China, and seeks to understand the adoption of traceability both through an analytical model, and empirical analysis based on data collected through an extensive (largest ever) field survey of Chinese aquatic wholesale markets. The field survey includes 76 managers and 753 vendors, covering all aquatic wholesale markets in Zhejiang and Hunan provinces. The analytical and empirical results suggest that the adoption of traceability among wholesale market vendors is significantly associated with inspection intensity, their individual history of food safety problems, and their risk awareness. The effect of inspection intensity on traceability adoption is stronger in markets which are privately owned than in markets with state/collective ownership. The analysis offers insights into the current state of traceability in China. More importantly, it suggests several hypothesized factors that might affect the adoption of traceability and could be leveraged by regulatory organizations to improve it.

AB Purpose Organic rice forms the largest portion of the Thai organic food market. Because of its increasing popularity, marketers need to better understand consumer behaviour to address emerging concerns regarding product safety and quality and to tailor better marketing strategies relevant to the development of organic rice. As such, this study aims to examine consumers' purchase intention towards organic rice, using traceability information, and to investigate the direct and moderating roles of product traceability knowledge, using the theory of planned behaviour. Design/methodology/approach Responses were collected from 243 organic rice consumers in a farmers' market in Chachoengsao Province, Thailand, following a convenience sampling approach. The gathered data were analysed using structural equation modelling to evaluate the strength of the relationship between the constructs. Findings The findings reveal that subjective norms, health consciousness and product traceability knowledge have a significant positive influence on consumers' intention to purchase organic rice. This study also establishes the moderating role of product traceability knowledge in perceived behavioural control and purchase intention, indicating that elaborated product information through traceability is essential for consumers who feel capable of buying the product. However, the direct effects of attitude and perceived behavioural control are insignificant, indicating the presence of external barriers to the purchase of organic rice, and that people may have a negative attitude towards the product. In addition, the cost perception result reveals that consumers consider price as an indicator of organic product quality, thereby increasing their desirability. Social implications The findings of this study will help community enterprises in Thailand develop a more effective marketing strategy based on the identified motivators of organic rice purchase intention. Originality/value This study develops a model that integrates important factors related to organic food consumption to generate a more comprehensive analysis of this mainstream research. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is also the first study to investigate the moderating role of product traceability knowledge to obtain a new and more focused understanding of how this factor influences purchase intention when applied explicitly to organic food. Finally, the findings provide theoretical contributions and implications for both the community enterprise and policymakers on developing strategies for organic rice marketing among community enterprises in Thailand.

AB There is a growing enthusiasm among consumers for high value lamb, especially the lamb with certain geographical indications, which may result in possible fraudulent labeling due to the opportunity for large economic profits. On such a basis, the aim of this study was to improve the discrimination rate of geographical traceability of lamb. To achieve this objective, lamb samples obtained from four different regions from China and New Zealand were analyzed. The chemical profiles of lamb samples from different origins were characterized by stable isotope analysis, multi-element determination, and fatty-acid profile, and further subjected to a series of statistical analyses, including principal component analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis, and principal component analysis-linear discriminant analysis. Compared with the result obtained by using each method individually, data fusion by ratio modulation of multi-technique clearly improved the discrimination performance for origin traceability. A satisfactory discrimination rate of 100% was obtained after ratio modulation of these techniques. Comprehensively, this study offers proof of concept for a promising method that could be used for lamb provenance authentication and fraud detection.

AB Traceability information as a solution option becomes an important task for the industry in providing products, preparing sustainable raw materials, and ensuring adequate safety quality. The emergence of these demands makes the industry perform tracking in order to prepare product inventories ranging from raw materials to products that have been produced. Based on these reasons, the scope of this paper is to provide a systematic review of the literature on various aspects of implementing information traceability models and sustainability of supply chain on economic, social, environmental, technological, institutional, and infrastructural dimensions. For this purpose, we use the Scopus, Science Direct, EBSCO Host, and ProQuest databases. We used the PRISMA model to identify, filter, and test for the eligibility of articles to be included. We selected 52 articles contributed by this search engine. We found was that between 2018 to 2021 there was increasing interest in this research. The dominant traceability information model in the article uses blockchain, the rest use operations research (OR), Google Earth Engine (GEE), website-based, Unified Modeling Language (UML), Extensible Markup Language (XML), physical markup language (PML), logit, enterprise resource planning (ERP), soft independent modelling of class analogies (SIMCA), and Spatially Explicit Information on Production to Consumption Systems (SEI-PCS).

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of origin, genotype, and their interaction on multielement fingerprints in wheat kernels to provide theoretical basis for geographical traceability. Ten varieties were grown in three different regions of China during the 2010-2011 growing seasons. The concentrations of 10 elements (Na, Mg, Ca, V, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Mo, and Ba) were determined in 90 wheat kernel samples and 30 provenance soil samples. Multiway analysis of variance results demonstrated that both origin and genotype had significant influences on the content of each element, and their interaction had significant influences on the contents of Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Mo, and Ba. The elements Na, Ca, Fe, Zn, and Mo were associated with origin, and Mg, Mn, Cu, and Ba were related to genotype. Na, Ca, Fe, Zn, and Mo were proved to be good indicators to discriminate wheat geographical origin.

AB The aim of this work was to develop a DNA microsatellite-based method of analysis to allow traceability of the three Italian Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) table olives in comparison with fruits of another seven highly diffused table olive cultivars. The analyses were carried out by using 16 primer pairs, with a mean of five different alleles detected per primer set, and power of discrimination from 0.56 to 0.90. Allelic error rates in the range of 0-3.8% were observed. By combining data from the most reliable and highly informative microsatellites (DCA3, DCA16, DCA17, DCA18, UDO-043, and GAPU101), it was possible to identify the PDO fruits over the panel of 10 cultivars, with the probability of a chance match between different cultivars as low as 10(-9) and with 0.5% error rate. The amplification profile is independent of environmental and processing conditions and is helpful to verify the authenticity of PDO samples.

AB A distribution traceability management system for imported beef based on ubiquitous information technology (u-IT) was developed by the Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in Korea to manage the distribution traceability and to trade reliable beef. The system was developed for the seller, government official, and consumer, separately by considering users' convenience, Distributors of imported beef registered and managed the distribution traceability on the computerized system, and government officials could monitor distribution managements and deal with recall immediately when the beef at risk was alerted. The information for the imported risk beef is rapidly transferred by the Sort Message Service (SMS), and sales of beef can be prevented by an electronic balance based on u-IT or by a credit card terminal. The developed system will be broadly used from December 2010 after testing the system within restricted areas as a model.

AB This study reports the findings for an analysis using the computer program NAADSM (North American Animal Disease Spread Model) and a supply-driven social accounting matrix to examine the impact of a hypothetical foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak in a relatively isolated part of the United States, Utah, under various levels of livestock traceability. The analysis demonstrates that a significant regional economic impact in Utah would result from an FMD outbreak but that improved levels of traceability would be very important in helping to reduce the negative economic consequences of the outbreak.

AB The aim of this work is to realize a term map analysis on technological advancements, in the year and in the world, of scientific researches of food traceability. Quality protection needs efficient instruments to discriminate Protected Denomination of Origin and Protected Geographical Indication varieties in field and to trace them along the agri-food chain. This study attempts to analyze global scientific of food traceability researches (between 1999 and 2018). In this period, 2534 scientific publications by Scopus database were found. Publication trends, research topics and their geographical distribution were analyzed by science mapping (VOSviewer software). Term map evidenced four main groups: red cluster with terms about food product and analytical methods for the characterization of food; green cluster including terms related with consumer (e.g., "food safety" and "food packaging"); blue cluster associating terms with the technology for traceability and yellow cluster with identification of food by genetic marker. It is possible to observe many links (i.e., co-occurrence between terms) in the green and blue clusters and among them. The yellow cluster could be considered as a subcategory of red one. In addition, green cluster refers to consumer and food safety. Yellow and red clusters contain analytical methods to identify food product, while blue cluster refers to advancements technological transferring information about the product to the consumer. These clusters do not present many linkages, and the consumer is in-between these. Finally, this study contributes to a better knowing of food traceability, and to an enhanced scientific research of technological advancements in supply chain.

AB Shrimp products play a vital role in the international trade of fisheries products. The main suppliers for shrimp products are developing nations such as Vietnam, Thailand, Bangladesh, and other countries in Southeast Asia. Among them, Vietnam is one of the largest exporters of shrimp products, and developed countries, especially the United States (US), Europe, and Japan, are key importers of shrimp in the global market. An increase in the demand for shrimp products has led to the development of traceability regulations in developed countries. In this study, Pressure-State-Response (PSR) concepts are applied to evaluate the implementation responses of traceability regulations by exporting countries to meet the mandatory requirements of global markets. The evaluation was based on the prepared questions that were developed to allow comparison of specified indicators in the traceability regulations of importing countries and those of Vietnam. The examination showed that importing countries have introduced stringent traceability regulations via legislation and quality assurance practices. Regarding measures taken by exporting countries, Vietnam has introduced traceability regulations for both shrimp and other seafood products. Thus, Vietnamese regulations were found to satisfy the regulations of importing countries. However, the implementation of these regulations has faced a number of challenges, largely because of complicated of distribution channels, small-scale production, price discrimination, and a lack capital to apply for international certificates.

AB The independent and highly heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been shown suitable for meat traceability. The microRNAs (miRNAs) that were differently expressed among regions could be used for meat origin traceability. In the present study, ten SNPs from 148 Chinese beef cattle were screened by HRM. The results showed that these SNPs were all suitable for beef traceability with the probability error rate of .308. These cattle could not be clustered into different regions based on the SNP genotyping, which indicated that the SNPs assay was suitable for individual traceability. High throughput sequencing revealed that 16 miRNAs were up-regulated expression and 18 miRNAs were down-regulated expression in JL group (eastern part) compared to XJ group (western part). RT-PCR confirmed that bta-miR-2284ab and bta-miR-486 were differently expressed in Jilin and Xinjiang samples. Thus, the two miRNAs could be used as biomarkers for origin traceability.
   Practical applicationsTo solve meat safety problems, meat traceability is extremely important. SNPs-based technology can trace animal individuals and miRNAs-based technology can do origin traceability. Once suitable primers could be designed for a sufficient number of SNP loci, these primers could be loaded on an array, and then traceability could be realized by HRM. We identified the miRNAs that were differently expressed among regions and beef origin traceability could be realized by analyzing them using RT-PCR. All the detection methods are rapidly and cost-effectively. A combination of SNPs- and miRNAs-based technologies can implement traceability management of beef cattle.

AB Wine is a high-value alcoholic beverage welcomed by consumers because of its flavor and nutritional value. The key information on wine bottle label is the basis of consumers' choice, which also becomes a target for manufacturers to adulterate, including geographical origin, grape variety and vintage. With the improvement of wine adulteration technology, modern technological means are needed to solve the above mentioned problems. The chemical basis of wine determines the type of technique used. Detection technology can be subdivided into four groups: mass spectrometry techniques, spectroscopic techniques, chromatography techniques, and other techniques. Multivariate statistical analysis of the data was performed by means of chemometrics methods. This paper outlines a series of procedures for wine classification and identification, and classified the analytical techniques and data processing methods used in recent years with listing their principles, advantages and disadvantages to help wine researchers choose appropriate methods to meet the challenge and ensure wine traceability and authenticity.

AB Food authenticity, traceability and provenance are emerging issues of major concern for consumers, industries and regulatory bodies worldwide. In addition, both food safety and security are an intrinsic component of food quality where the above issues are key in modern traceability and management systems. It has been reported that substitution of a high-quality species by less expensive ones might be a frequent practice in seafood products such as fish and shellfish. In this type of products, the source (e.g., origin) and identification of the species are complex. Although different countries have implemented strict regulations and labelling protocols, these issues still are of concern. This article briefly reviews some of the most recent applications of vibrational spectroscopy (near and mid infrared, Raman) combined with chemometrics to target some of these issues in the seafood and fish industries.

AB Fish maws (dried swimbladders of fishes) are regarded as traditional luxurious delicacies, medicine and tonics, which have been recommended and consumed in Asia over many centuries. At the commercial level, they are ranked as different values based on species. However, fish maw species and the trade are still unknown and undocumented. The processing treatments make them difficult for species identification based on morphological characterization. In the present study, the genetic identification of the main commercialized species of fish maws has been carried out, based on the amplification of a fragment of mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene and subsequent BLAST analysis. The applicability of all kinds of processed. products was verified, including dried, water soaked; salt fried and salt fried plus water soaked forms. The result indicated this method was applicable to all of them, showed that 53.3% of the products were incorrectly labeled and 58.3% of "croaker" products were substituted with catfish or perch species. Moreover, results indicated that besides traditional trade in Asia, the fish maw trade has been globally expanded to meet the growing demand of market. Therefore, this method can be useful in normative control of processed products, particularly in the authenticity of imported species, verifying the correct traceability in commercial trade, the correct labeling, and also for fisheries control of endangered species to conserve stocks biodiversity.

ID TRACEABILITY
AB Documentation is a major component of any traceability system where traceability is defined in the ISO Regulation 8402:1994 as the ability to trace the history, application and location of what is under consideration. Traceability systems are record keeping systems designed to track the flow of product or product attributes through the production process or supply chain. All international supply chains are forced to comply with traceability requirements. In this paper, we develop and implement an end-to-end mobile application prototype that traces the poultry production. This application consists of front-end and back-end systems. At the front-end, the worker uses a GPRS enabled handheld device (cell phone, PDA, etc.) to capture information on poultry operations collected at a remote chicken farm and transmit it to a back-end server in the main office. Through customized application the back-end server analyses all information received from the front-end and based on a built-in business process and business rules, intelligently updates various stakeholders of any breach of bio-security measures that requires immediate attention. The proposed system administrators can also access this application via Internet for management decision making. The back-end system consists of web server, defined business application logic and database server. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Small, coded, pill sized tracers embedded in grains are proposed as a method to store a historical record of grains and retrieve coded information for grain traceability. This study aimed to develop and validate a statistical sampling procedure to securely collect sample sizes (kg) and number of tracers since the sampling accuracy is critical in the proposed traceability system for capturing information and data related to grain lots to trace the grain back through the route in a grain supply chain. The statistical results and observations showed similar concentrations and insignificant segregation of tracers in bin and truck operations. The number of tracers required for identification of grain sources fell within the confidence intervals and sample sizes (kg) estimated by statistical probability methods. Truck sampling appeared more feasible in collecting the secure number of tracers over bin sampling. The designed sampling process was empirically proven to be practically applicable and provide better scientific assurance of sampling accuracy, which may reduce economic risks and their consequent costs caused by unfavorable sampling in the propose traceability system.

AB Global food trade has become an increasingly crucial element for feeding the world's population. Enhancing bilateral or multilateral trust in food safety in international food trade is not only important for promoting the sustainable development of trade but is also beneficial for cooperation when facing a global food crisis. However, highly credible traceability systems (TSs) for the cross-border movement of food are still absent in many countries and regions. Blockchain is regarded as a promising technology that can help build trust for transparency and security issues. In this paper, an interconnected conceptual traceability framework based on blockchain is proposed in order to increase trust in food safety during food trade. Taking the food trade between China and the European Union as an example, a conceptual framework is designed in order to take full advantage of existing TSs in these two locations, and the features of logistical flow, data flow, and blockchain flow are analyzed. Considering the data capacity and data privacy level, a hybrid data storage method combining on-chain and off-chain is adopted. Smart contracts according to the features of cross-border food trade-including the recording of exportation data, exporter inspection data, shipment data, importer inspection data, importation data, and tracing queries-are packaged and deployed to a blockchain network. An effective operation mechanism involving the distribution of related rights for different roles is presented. The blockchain-based TS framework has the advantages of enhancing bilateral trust in cross-border food trade, providing a flexible and intelligent technical framework, and having effective operability. Future challenges, such as data security, special smart contracts, and consensus mechanisms, and interoperability with other systems, are discussed.

TI Development and assessment of blockchain-IoT-based traceability system
   for frozen aquatic product
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD PROCESS ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB This study puts forward a novel frozen aquatic product traceability system (BIOT-TS) that based on blockchain and Internet of things (IoT) technology, which can alleviate the drawbacks of current tracing management during cold chain logistic, such as the weak security performance, inefficient centralized data management as well as the easy-tampered traceability information. The proposed system possesses the advantages of decentralization, safety, reliability, and tamper-proofing when it compares with traditional tracking technology. It is particularly suitable for multi-stages tracking management of cold chain logistics from aquaculture, production, logistics, and circulation to sales. In terms of such blockchain-IoT-based technology, the system is deployed and evaluated with the case of frozen turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) that is circulated and sold under the background of e-commerce cold chain logistics. It can significantly improve the quality and safety of the frozen aquatic product by using smart contracts, consensus strategy, and data on-chain verification technology. The overall involved participants can share more reliable tracing information after adopting this tracing system. Furthermore, the performance of this hybrid tracing technology has been evaluated by the operations of on-chain process and tracing queries through the real experiments, and has testified to be effective. Therefore, the application of this system is beneficial for the improvement of the aquatic food logistics industry and ensures credit in its ecosystem.
   Practical Applications The blockchain-IoT-based frozen aquatic product traceability management is one of the most promising technologies that possess the advantages of tamper-proof, transparent, and irrefutable transactions combined with distributed monitoring and tracking functionalities. Through the decentralized data management, smart contract, and mechanism of consensus, the traceability information is partitioned and encrypted storage, which can be used for government supervision and consumers' retroactive queries. This novel frozen aquatic food product tracing technology can fundamentally improve the reliability of quality tracing applications and make the closely related tracing management more transparent, secure, and efficient.

AB Traceability requirements in supply chain management are getting more and more strict in order to ensure product quality and public safety. Such requirements are particularly difficult to reach in the agro-food sector, especially for fresh ready-to-eat (RTE) vegetables, where specific needs exist: for example, mixed RTE salads are made of different produces, and there is the need to track and trace the treatments all the ingredients separately receive, avoiding gaps in the electronic histories. Traceability global standards, along with the adoption of Radio Frequency (RF) technologies have been widely experimented in this field; nevertheless, there are still many difficulties. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) cause a big impact on the existing information system, and meet the opposition of professionals in the field such as agronomists who feel out of the process. Additionally, Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID)-based item-level traceability is still too expensive.
   In this paper, we propose an integrated and innovative solution for the "gapless" traceability of fresh RTE vegetables produced by an Italian agro-food company. Most approaches to sensor-based implementations completely replace agronomists. By contrast, our solution keeps the agronomists in the greenhouses but empowers them with smart technology. The Agronomist Android mobile App uses Near Field Communication (NFC) technology to allow the linking of plants and traceability information, following the EPCglobal standard. We achieve low costs by using DataMatrix technology for item-level tagging, while restricting the use of UHF RFID to coarse-grained grouping levels (case and pallet). We adopt the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) architectural style for granting flexibility and scalability while preserving compatibility with legacy applications. We obtained the experimental results we report by using a Living Laboratory approach; the experiments we carried on have demonstrated the good performances of RFID tags and readers when used in conjunction with fresh vegetables products, as well as the actual effectiveness of the proposed gapless traceability system.

AB The objective of this research was to characterize the efficiency and convenience of sheep identification system and its implementation costs. Therefore we quantified the time for implementation, reading and data transfer to a management program in a manual system (earrings) and electronic system (subcutaneous transponders). Furthermore, it was evaluated the implementation costs of the traceability systems by analysis of the absorption costs and comparison between systems. It was observed that the implementation time for the manual system was shorter (2.2 s animal(-1)) than the electronic system (4.67 s animal(-1)). As for reading time, the electronic system presented shorter time (2.89 s animal(-1)) than the manual system (4.67 s animal(-1)). As for the data transfer time, the electronic system also presented shorter time (16 s) than manual system (6 min and 42 s). In terms of economic costs, the manual system presented lower implementation costs and lower values per tracked animal to ensure the economic viability. In conclusion, the producer must analyze the context around the production unit to choose the best traceability system.

AB Groundnut oil (GNO)/peanut oil is one of the agro-food products with great economic value and hence an attractive target for adulteration and mislabeling. Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR) are markers of choice for DNA fingerprinting studies as they exhibit high polymorphism due to variable number of repeats. Hence, this study was designed to evaluate and optimize a method for DNA isolation from groundnut oil and study the possibility of using the isolated DNA for molecular traceability using SSR markers. Four methods to isolate DNA from groundnut oil were evaluated. All the four methods were modified CTAB protocols, but differed in procedures for extraction, buffer compositions, amount of oil used and DNA carriers. For molecular traceability of oils, extraction and recovery of DNA from edible oil is a key step, especially in refined oils. A method that employed DNA enrichment prior to extraction with CTAB buffer yielded amplifiable DNA from cold pressed GNO, crude hexane extracted GNO and refined GNO. The optimized method for isolation of DNA from groundnut oil is simple, efficient, less costly and reproducible when compared to chromatography and spectroscopy based techniques.

AB In this study, elemental composition differences of soybeans were analysed from four regions of the Chinese Heilongjiang Province (Daqing, Suihua, Heihe, and Jiamusi), and the characteristic fingerprints representative of the producing areas were screened. The contents of 25 elements in soybeans from the four producing areas were determined using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS), and the geographical sources of soybean were identified using difference, correlation, cluster heat map, and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analyses (OPLS-DA). The results of the difference and correlation analyses showed that the elemental compositions were significantly affected by the soil environment for growth, and there were significant differences in element content among the four soybean-producing areas with regional characteristics. Heat map clustering showed the aggregation of the element content among different producing areas, distinguished the samples, and allowed classification of all elements. A discriminant model was established for the samples in the training set using the indices of 17 screened elements, including Mg, Al, K, Mn, Mo, p, Cu, Cr, Rb, Ni, Ca, Fe, Se, Pd, Zn, Ga, and Pb, and was used for the prediction and analysis of soybean samples in the testing set. Overall, the correct discrimination rate of the four soybean samples was 93.33%, which indicated these 17 elements contained sufficient information representative of the soybean-producing areas. Furthermore, they could be used as stable and effective traceability indicators to identify the production area of soybean samples from the four producing areas in Heilongjiang Province.

AB The feasibility of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) (400-1000 nm) for tracing the chemical spoilage extent of the raw meat used for two kinds of processed meats was investigated. Calibration models established separately for salted and cooked meats using full wavebands showed good results with the determination coefficient in prediction (R-P(2)) of 0.887 and 0.832, respectively. For simplifying the calibration models, two variable selection methods were used and compared. The results showed that genetic algorithm-partial least squares (GA-PLS) with as much continuous wavebands selected as possible always had better performance. The potential of HSI to develop one multispectral system for simultaneously tracing the chemical spoilage extent of the two kinds of processed meats was also studied. Good result with an R-P(2) of 0.854 was obtained using GA-PLS as the dimension reduction method, which was thus used to visualize total volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N) contents corresponding to each pixel of the image.

AB The ability to trace the movement of animals and their related products is key to success in animal disease control. To ensure that a traceability system is optimized, livestock farmers and traders must have good appreciation and understanding about animal tracing. The present study examined the traceability of cattle in Malaysia vis-a-vis the domains of knowledge, attitude, and practice among cattle farmers and traders. A total of 543 farmers and traders in Peninsular Malaysia were interviewed. The results revealed that over 60% of the respondents had satisfactory knowledge and attitude about cattle movement and traceability. A lower proportion of the respondents (49%) were involved in appropriate practice that facilitated traceability of cattle. We found that the type of husbandry system and stakeholders' participation in livestock management-specific short courses were positively associated with satisfactory knowledge, attitude, and practice. A structured education and training program should be formulated to improve these domains so that the benefit of traceability becomes clear, paving the way to a successful traceability program.

AB Log traceability in the timber based industries is a basic requirement to fulfil economical, social and legal requirements. This work introduces biometric log recognition using digital log end images and explores the robustness to a set of log end cross-section (CS) variations. In order to investigate longitudinal and surface CS variations three tree logs were sliced and captured in different sessions. A texture feature-based technique well known from fingerprint recognition is adopted to compute and match biometric templates of CS images captured from log ends. In the experimental evaluation insights and constraints on the general applicability and robustness of log end biometrics to identify logs in an industrial application are presented. Results for different identification performance scenarios indicate that the matching procedure which is based on annual ring pattern and shape information is very robust to log length cutting using different cutting tools. The findings of this study are a further step towards the development of a biometric log recognition system. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The geographical distribution of medicinal plants significantly affect the quality and safety of Chinese medicinal materials. From the biological point of view, Chinese medicinal materials are formed during the long-term ecological adaptation of species affected by a specific ecological environment. The climate, soil, hydrology, and other ecological factors required for the growth of medicinal materials are closely related to their growth and quality and have fingerprint characteristics of geographical information. In recent years, the rapid development of the Chinese medicine industry has brought about a surge in demand for Chinese medicine resources. However, at the same time, there are also many potential safety hazards. The difficulty in distinguishing and tracing the origin of Chinese medicinal materials has become one of the main bottlenecks restricting the development of traditional Chinese medicine. In this study, 75 A. argyi samples from 5 major producing areas of 4 provinces in China were analyzed by FTIR for characteristic analysis and data mining. Spectral signal preprocessing methods include Gaussian filtering, multivariate scattering correction, standard normal transformation, first/second derivative, etc. and pattern recognition techniques include BP neural network model, random forest, K-nearest neighbor, Bayesian algorithm, particle swarm optimization support vector machine, etc. were applied to explore the feasibility of traceability for A. argyi. The results indicate that the algorithms of K-nearest neighbor, Bayesian, and particle swarm optimization support vector machine show the ideal recognition effect, with an accuracy of 100%. Considering the comprehensive factors of running time, identification accuracy, and model stability, the algorithm of K-nearest neighbor is determined as the best method to trace the origin of A. argyi. In general, FTIR technology combined with appropriate chemometrics methods can be used to trace the origin of A. argyi successfully. The results of this study can provide technical support for the evaluation and quality control of A. argyi, and also contribute useful reference for the isotropic research of other medicinal materials.

AB Different geographical environment has a certain influence on the accumulation of fungi elements and chemical components. However, our knowledge is limited to elucidate the fungi elements in response to heterogeneous environmental and the quality differences among different habitats. Here, multielement analysis, FTIR spectrum, and feature-level fusion technique combined with chemometrics were used to study Wolfiporia cocos from different geographical areas, different sampling sites and different altitude sources. From the results, (1) there is significant difference in element content of samples from different sampling sites and no positive correlation with geographical ranges. (2) There is a correlation between elevation and elements, and relatively low elevation (<1,800 m) is conducive to the enrichment of elements. (3) From the perspective of elements, the W. cocos in Yuxi have relatively better quality. (4) FTIR and feature-level models can well realize origin identification. The SVM models are better than the PLS-DA models, and the feature-level model is better than the single FTIR models. In summary, this study demonstrated that the developed method was reliable and could realize the genuineness evaluation and origin identification of W. cocos. The results have implications for the establishment of the technology system of geographical traceability and the development of high-quality geographical indication products of W. cocos.

AB To achieve the traceability of wine varieties, a method was proposed to fuse Near-infrared (NW) spectra and cyclic voltammograms (CV) which contain different information using D-S evidence theory. NW spectra and CV curves of three different varieties of wines (cabernet sauvignon, merlot, cabernet gernischt) which come from seven different geographical origins were collected separately. The discriminant models were built using PLS-DA method. Based on this, D-S evidence theory was then applied to achieve the integration of the two kinds of discrimination results. After integrated by D-S evidence theory, the accuracy rate of cross-validation is 95. 69% and validation set is 94. 12% for wine variety identification. When only considering the wine that come from Yantai, the accuracy rate of cross-validation is 99. 46% and validation set is 100%. All the traceability models after fusion achieved better results on classification than individual method. These results suggest that the proposed method combining electrochemical information with spectral information using the D-S evidence combination formula is benefit to the improvement of model discrimination effect, and is a promising tool for discriminating different kinds of wines.

AB Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) breeding in China has a history of nearly 70 years. Yunnan province represents the second largest sugarcane planting area in China; therefore, by studying the evolution of sugarcane varieties in this region, it is possible to gain an understanding of the process of improvement since the foundation of sugarcane hybrid breeding. In this study, we compared the main industrial and agronomical characteristics of 107 sugarcane varieties, developed between 1952 and 2020, and discussed the reasons for replacement and exchange. Overall, significant differences were observed (p < 0.01), highlighting notable improvements, especially in terms of yield; however, disease incidence remains a serious issue and the fundamental reason for variety replacement. Meanwhile, analysis of parent traceability revealed that the main varieties cultivated at present have a similar parental relationship based around CP, F, and YC series germplasms. Taken together, these findings suggest that disease-resistant breeding should be strengthened, and susceptible varieties eliminated, while making full use of existing varieties as core parents.

AB The development of a colorimetric mono-varietal discriminating assay, aimed at improving traceability and quality control checks of durum wheat products, is described. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was identified as a reliable marker for wheat varietal discrimination, and a rapid test for easy and clear identification of specific wheat varieties was developed. Notably, an approach based on the loop-mediated isothermal amplification reaction (LAMP) as an SNP discrimination tool, in combination with naked-eye visualization of the results, was designed and optimized. Our assay was proven to be effective in the detection of adulterated food products, including both substitution and mixing with different crop varieties.

AB Due to the worldwide importance and public interest concerning to the food quality and safety, there is a growing trend in the geographical trace of food products with various techniques. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate integrated information as an effective strategy for the geographical traceability of wild Boletus tomentipes. To this goal, 76 fruiting bodies were collected, and two mushroom parts (pileus and stipe) were analyzed by Fourier transform-mid infrared (FT-MIR) spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). Five related data matrices (FT-MIR_P, FT-MIR_S, ELE_P, ELE_S and ELE_Q(C/S)) were fused at low- and mid-level, support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classification algorithms combined with data matrices were used for authenticating the geographical origin. The results of multivariate statistical analysis indicate that data fusion, taking advantage of the information synergy, shows the better classification performance than individual decision making. Also, the comparison of categorized result between two fusion levels suggests that, mid-level data fusion is more stable than low-level among different type models, which could be used as a reliable method for the geographical authentication purposes of wild porcini mushrooms.

AB Neutron activation analysis (NAA), based on the comparator method, has the potential to fulfill the requirements of a primary ratio method as defined in 1998 by the Comite Consultatif pour la Quantite de Matiere - Metrologie en Chimie (CCQM, Consultative Committee on Amount of Substance - Metrology in Chemistry). This thesis is evidenced in this paper in three chapters by: demonstration that the method is fully physically and chemically understood; that a measurement equation can be written down in which the values of all parameters have dimensions in SI units and thus having the potential for metrological traceability to these units; that all contributions to uncertainty of measurement can be quantitatively evaluated, underpinning the metrological traceability; and that the performance of NAA in CCQM key-comparisons of trace elements in complex matrices between 2000 and 2007 is similar to the performance of Isotope Dilution Mass Spectrometry (IDMS), which had been formerly designated by the CCQM as a primary ratio method.

AB Farm livestock identification and welfare assessment using non-invasive digital technology have gained interest in agriculture in the last decade, especially for accurate traceability. This study aimed to develop a face recognition system for dairy farm cows using advanced deep-learning models and computer vision techniques. This approach is non-invasive and potentially applicable to other farm animals of importance for identification and welfare assessment. The video analysis pipeline follows standard human face recognition systems made of four significant steps: (i) face detection, (ii) face cropping, (iii) face encoding, and (iv) face lookup. Three deep learning (DL) models were used within the analysis pipeline: (i) face detector, (ii) landmark predictor, and (iii) face encoder. All DL models were finetuned through transfer learning on a dairy cow dataset collected from a robotic dairy farm located in the Dookie campus at The University of Melbourne, Australia. Results showed that the accuracy across videos from 89 different dairy cows achieved an overall accuracy of 84%. The computer program developed may be deployed on edge devices, and it was tested on NVIDIA Jetson Nano board with a camera stream. Furthermore, it could be integrated into welfare assessment previously developed by our research group.

AB With the continuous development of jellyfish fisheries and food products around the world, an effective traceability system has become increasingly prominent. This study provides insight into the origin traceability and authentication of two commercially important jellyfish species, flame jellyfish Rhopilema esculentum and Nomura's jellyfish Nemopilema nomurai, while investigating the intra- and inter-specific variation in fatty acid (FA) profiles and carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15). Results showed significant differences in FA profiles and isotopic values in fresh bell tissues between wild and farmed R. esculentum and among geographic origins, possibly due to different food sources, nutritional status, and energy costs that each group experiences at a given location. The linear discriminant analysis indicated that delta C-13, delta N-15, C16:0, C17:0, C18:0, C16:1n7, and C20:5n3 were suitable discriminatory variables with a high rate of correct classification for distinguishing origins of R. esculentum. In addition, inter-specific FA profiles/biomarkers, combined with isotopic values, suggests the variety of dietary sources and trophic positions of sympatric similar-sized R. esculentum and N. nomurai and the potential use of biomarkers, especially stable isotope analysis, for distinguishing sympatric jellyfish species. These results highlighted the complementarity of FA and stable isotope analyses and provide an alternative approach for improving the origin traceability and authenticity evaluation of untreated edible jellyfish. Furthermore, this study adds new information regarding the biochemical compositions of jellyfish species.

SO COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
ID IDENTIFICATION; PIGS
AB The suckling piglet is a typical niche meat product traditionally slaughtered before weaning at nearly one month of age. Due to African Swine Fever (ASF) foci and dumping phenomenon the pork production system of the island suffers from exportation restriction and competition with imported of pork products from GDO circuits, often claimed as local. A bottom-up analysis highlighted the need to establish a robust system of origin and brand protection for the suckling piglet labelled "Suinetto di Sardegna". Previous experiences tested the opportunity offered by the integrated system of identification of animal and products based on the RFID technology, paired with molecular analysis (DNA) for meat traceability. This study reports the economic evaluation of such a smart traceability system, through the introduction of technologically advanced tools in the traditional process of production. A comparative evaluation of conventional vs. RFID + DNA system was carried out and costs are compared. The break even point (BEP) calculated following the potential investment for the adoption of the RFID + DNA system for origin and brand protection highlighted that the abattoir of the circuit "Suinetto di Sardegna" should sell at least 17 piglets or the equivalent of 1305.00 euros in sales before any profits could be realized. In the light of production capacity of an extensive traditional farming system, this value requires high numbers of production units (unit = whole carcass of suckling piglet). In addition, this economic evaluation was only related to representative farms and did not take into account seasonal fluctuations or effective geo-distribution of farms, but was based on average yearly production and spatial distance of farms from abattoir. Decreasing trend of costs due to massive deployment of RFID and the diffusion of molecular analyses for traceability purposes may be forecasted and minimum acceptable levels of economic BEP can be achieved in a short period. If the new technology becomes a standard for the traceability of the suckling piglet, incremental benefits can arise from the reinforcement of the brand "Suinetto di Sardegna".

AB Farm Management Information Systems (FMISs) are being expanded to improve operation efficiency, reduce inputs, and ensure compliance with standards and regulations. However, this goal is difficult to attain in the vegetable sector, where data acquisition is time-consuming and data at different stages is fragmented by the potential diversity of crops and multiple batches cultivated at any given farm. This applies, in particular, to farms in China, which have small areas and low degrees of mechanization. This study presents an integrated approach to track and trace production efficiently through our Digital Farm Management System (DFMS), which adopts the cloud framework and utilizes Quick Response (QR) codes and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. Specifically, a data acquisition system is proposed that runs on a smartphone for the efficient gathering of planting information in the field. Moreover, DFMS generates statistics and analyses of planting areas, costs, and yields. DFMS meets the FMIS requirements and provides the accurate tracking and tracing of the production for each batch in an efficient manner. The system has been applied in a large-scale vegetable production enterprise, consisting of 12 farms distributed throughout China. This application shows that DFMS is a highly efficient solution for precise vegetable farm management.

   Governance; Scalability; Traceability; Food Safety; Food Security
AB Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), such as blockchain, has the potential to transform supply chains. It can provide a cryptographically secure and immutable record of transactions and associated metadata (origin, contracts, process steps, environmental variations, microbial records, etc.) linked across whole supply chains. The ability to trace food items within and along a supply chain is legally required by all actors within the chain. It is critical to food safety, underpins trust and global food trade. However, current food traceability systems are not linked between all actors within the supply chain. Key metadata on the age and process history of a food is rarely transferred when a product is bought and sold through multiple steps within the chain. Herein, we examine the potential of massively scalable DLT to securely link the entire food supply chain, from producer to end user. Under such a paradigm, should a food safety or quality issue ever arise, authorized end users could instantly and accurately trace the origin and history of any particular food item. This novel and unparalleled technology could help underpin trust for the safety of all food, a critical component of global food security. In this paper, we investigate the (i) data requirements to develop DLT technology across whole supply chains, (ii) key challenges and barriers to optimizing the complete system, and (iii) potential impacts on production efficiency, legal compliance, access to global food markets and the safety of food. Our conclusion is that while DLT has the potential to transform food systems, this can only be fully realized through the global development and agreement on suitable data standards and governance. In addition, key technical issues need to be resolved including challenges with DLT scalability, privacy and data architectures.

AB Nowadays, stable isotope technology, DNA technology, spectroscopic technology, volatilomics technology, metabolomic analysis, mineral elements analysis and fatty acid analysis have been used to trace the origin of beef. Stable isotope technique is often combined with mineral elements analysis. Both of them have the advantages of high accuracy and low detection limit. Stable isotopes may be affected by geography and dietary history. The mineral elements analysis has high requirements for experimental operation. DNA technology is not affected by geography and dietary history, so it has unique advantages. It faces the problem of selecting molecular markers. Spectroscopic technology and volatilomics technology based on electronic nose do not require sample pretreatment. The limitation is that infrared and Raman are insensitive, and the data processing of hyperspectral image is difficult. Raman is much less sensitive than Infrared. The use of electronic nose has higher requirements for environment. Volatilomics technology based on mass spectrometry (MS), metabolomic analysis and fatty acid analysis have been used to analyze organic components. They can provide comprehensive information, but they have higher requirements for sample preservation. Metabolomic analysis equipment is expensive. The research on traceability and authenticity of beef can help to ensure the security and quality of beef.

AB Liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-Q/TOF) is a powerful tool to perform chemotaxonomic studies through identification of grape secondary metabolites. In the present work, the metabolomes of four autochthonous Italian red grape varieties including the chemical classes of anthocyanins, flavonols/flavanols/flavanones, and terpenol glycosides, were studied. By using this information, the metabolites that can potentially be used as chemical markers for the traceability of the corresponding wines were proposed. In Raboso wines, relatively high abundance of both anthocyanic and non-anthocyanic acyl derivatives, is expected. Potentially, Primitivo wines are characterized by high tri-substituted flavonoids, while Corvina wines are characterized by higher di-substituted compounds and lower acyl derivatives. Negro Amaro wine's volatile fraction is characterized by free monoterpenes, such as -terpineol, linalool, geraniol, and Ho-diendiol I. A similar approach can be applied for the traceability of other high-quality wines.

TI Printing data matrix code on food-grade tracers for grain traceability
SO BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID ROUGHNESS
AB A traceability system that enables grain to be traced from its point of origin throughout the supply chain is needed to improve food safety in cereal grains. Food-grade tracers - pill-sized particles with identity information printed on their surfaces - added to grain at harvest have been proposed as a means to realise a grain traceability system. Two types of such tracers (sugar-based and cellulose-based) have shown promise during previous research, but a means of applying identity information to them remains to be developed. In this study, a specialised ink-jet printer was used to print data matrix (DM) code symbols onto the tracers with food-grade ink, and the method's efficacy and the readability of the code were considered. Factors related to readability, including surface roughness of the tracers, were also considered. The printing of DM codes on sugar- and cellulose-based tracer particles was found to be readily feasible, and readability for both types was above 90%. The surface roughness of the sugar-based tracers was higher than that of the cellulose-based tracers, and readability of cellulose-based tracers was higher. However, for a given tracer type, readability increased slightly with surface roughness, indicating that some factor other than roughness - such as thermal conductivity of the tracer material - may be influencing the printing process and thus the readability of the code. Fundamentally, however, the successful printing of DM code onto food-grade tracers with food-grade ink is a novel and important step in developing a grain traceability system. (C) 2012 IAgrE.

AB Cow milk samples from various provinces in China were collected, and the effects of lactation stage, sampling time, and geographic origin on the samples were studied by elemental analysis-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (EA-IRMS). Traceability accuracy was determined using delta C-13, delta N-15, delta H-2 and delta O-18 values to specifically assign geographic origin. Stable isotope ratios of C, N, H and O were not significantly different among three lactation stages; however the delta C-13, delta N-15, and delta O-18 values of milk were influenced by sampling time. Furthermore, there were highly significant regional differences in the mean delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of milk. In summary, the lactation stage had no effect on the traceability of milk, whereas sampling time and geographic origin did affect milk traceability. Different geographic locations with a separation distance greater than 0.7 km can be distinguished using multi-element (C, N, H, O) stable isotope ratio analysis.

AB A combination of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with chemometrics tools provided an approach for studying Marsdenia tenacissima according to its geographical origin. A total of 128 M. tenacissima samples from four provinces in China were analyzed with FTIR spectroscopy. Six pattern recognition methods were used to construct the discrimination models: support vector machine-genetic algorithms, support vector machine-particle swarm optimization, K-nearest neighbors, radial basis function neural network, random forest and support vector machine-grid search. Experimental results showed that K-nearest neighbors was superior to other mathematical algorithms after data were preprocessed with wavelet de-noising, with a discrimination rate of 100% in both the training and prediction sets. This study demonstrated that FTIR spectroscopy coupled with K-nearest neighbors could be successfully applied to determine the geographical origins of M. tenacissima samples, thereby providing reliable authentication in a rapid, cheap and noninvasive way.

AB The efficiently extraction and accurately quantify of 0-carotene and its metabolites are crucial for authenticity and traceability in goat milk. Nevertheless, its reliability can be largely improved. In this study, meticulously designed native ESI-MS, fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular docking in combination with cold-induced acetonitrile aqueous two-phase separation system weaken the interaction between 0-lactoglobulin and 0-carotene metabolites and realized the efficiently extraction. Furthermore, established non-targeted quantitative metabolomics with optimal ion source and variable data-independent acquisition minimized the matrix effects and potential ion suppression. Validated atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-ultra high performance liquid chromatography-Orbitrap method showed that 0-carotene as distinctive biomarker in cow milk, and retinol, retinaldehyde, retinoic acid and abscisic acid in goat milk. Collectively, the proposed method is a powerful tool to detect cow adulteration risks in goat milk samples and provides valuable information for availability on authenticity of goat milk.

AB This study investigated the potential of using the changes in polyphenol composition of red wine to enable a more comprehensive chemometric differentiation and suitable identification of authentication markers. Based on high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) data collected from Feteasca Neagra, Merlot, and Cabernet Sauvignon finished wines, phenolic profiles of relevant classes were investigated immediately after vinification (Stage 1), after three months (Stage 2) and six months (Stage 3) of storage, respectively. The data were subjected to multivariate analysis, and resulted in an initial vintage differentiation by principal component analysis (PCA), and variety grouping by canonical discriminant analysis (CDA). Based on polyphenol common biosynthesis route and on the PCA correlation matrix, additional descriptors were investigated. We observed that the inclusion of specific compositional ratios into the data matrix allowed for improved sample differentiation. We obtained simultaneous discrimination according to the considered oenological factors (variety, vintage, and geographical origin) as well as the respective clustering applied during the storage period. Subsequently, further discriminatory investigations to assign wine samples to their corresponding classes relied on partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA); the classification models confirmed the clustering initially obtained by PCA. The benefits of the presented fingerprinting approach might justify its selection and warrant its potential as an applicable tool with improved authentication capabilities in red wines.

AB Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is applied widely in food cold chain logistics. However, traditional monitoring systems require significant real-time sensor data transmission which will result in heavy data traffic and communication systems overloading, and thus reduce the data collection and transmission efficiency. This research aims to develop a temperature Monitoring System for Frozen and Chilled Aquatic Products (MS-FCAP) based on WSN integrated with Compressed Sending (CS) to improve the efficiency of MS-FCAP. Through understanding the temperature and related information requirements of frozen and chilled aquatic products cold chain logistics, this paper illustrates the design of the CS model which consists of sparse sampling and data reconstruction, and shelf-life prediction. The system was implemented and evaluated in cold chain logistics between Hainan and Beijing in China. The evaluation result suggests that MS-FCAP has a high accuracy in reconstructing temperature data under variable temperature condition as well as under constant temperature condition. The result shows that MS-FCAP is capable of recovering the sampled sensor data accurately and efficiently, reflecting the real-time temperature change in the refrigerated truck during cold chain logistics, and providing effective decision support traceability for quality and safety assurance of frozen and chilled aquatic products.

AB Purpose - Geographical indications (GIs) have been implemented across the EU for agricultural and food products for many years and consumers know them well. However, developing countries and/or transitioning economies do not have sufficient experience to apply GIs. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate ways to implement GI in domestic markets in countries in which there are no common logo and control/tracking systems to help GI holders manage the process.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study uses a qualitative case study to describe a process to implement GI registered food products in domestic markets. The system was developed by the author and applied by the Gemlik Commodity Exchange (GTB).
   Findings - A registration system that allows inspection of producers in GI limits should be established. For good practice and to ensure correct registration, an efficient, established control system, promotion, and conservancy of GI-holding organizations are essential.
   Practical implications - GTB implemented two projects, for which a GI logo and labels with quick-response (QR) codes were created. A regional, GI promotion project was conducted, and after one year, there was no increase in consumer demand, but entering markets became easier, and traders of PDO products began to experience increases in orders and/or shortening of intervals. Long-term implications of the system could not be measured since one year had passed.
   Originality/value - This study develops and demonstrates a QR tracking system for implementation of GIs.

AB The application of a blockchain-based anti-counterfeiting traceability system (hereafter, blockchain-based ACTS) presents a positive effect on improving the unreliability of the freshness information. However, using a blockchain-based ACTS requires additional expenditures from chain members. Chain members want to know the investment conditions of a blockchain-based ACTS and how to coordinate their supply chain. To solve these problems, a supply chain with one fresh producer and one retailer was chosen as the study subject. Afterwards, considering the unreliability of the freshness information, the demand function was revised. Then, the profit functions before and after adopting a blockchain-based ACTS were constructed, and then a price discount and revenue-sharing contract was put forward to coordinate the supply chain. Findings: With the growth of the unreliability coefficient of the freshness information, benefits to chain members in the proposed three situations would be reduced. Thus, we can know that after using a blockchain-based ACTS, if chain members want to gain more benefits, they should try their best to excavate the value of the blockchain-based ACTS and reduce the unreliability coefficient of the freshness information.

AB Small invasive insects cause a reduction or disappearance of native insects, causing biodiversity problems. Therefore, tracking small insects is emerging as a method for biodiversity protection and ecosystem management; studies using tracking techniques, such as harmonic radar, RFID, and radio telemetry, are being conducted. A system using a mobile vehicle and a mobile robot that enhances the mobility of the existing passive tracking is currently being studied. We confirmed that radio telemetry is suitable for tracking insects by comparing the communication distance, weight, and lifespan of the transmitter in our previous study and developed a UAV-based tracking method. In this study, we quantified the size of insects and conducted behavior, traceability, and field tests to verify the feasibility and performance of the developed system. We confirmed that the transmitter attachment did not affect the behavior of the insect, and the three-dimensional movement of the insect did not affect the tracking performance. Furthermore, the tracking experiment was successfully conducted in a real environment. Thus, we quantitatively evaluated the performance of the proposed system and suggested a method to trace small-sized insects.

AB Due to the world-wide concern relating to herb quality and safety, there is a momentum to authenticate the geographical origin of herb with multi-platform techniques. This study attempted to assess multi platform information as a practical strategy for the geographical traceability of the fruits of Amomum tsao-ko. To this aim, one hundred and eighty dried fruits of A. tsao-ko from five geographical regions were analyzed by near infrared (NIR) and ultraviolet visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. On this basis, two variable dimension reduction strategies, including principal component analysis (PCA) and sequential and orthogonalized partial-least squares (SO-PLS), and two variables selection strategies, including variable importance in projection (VIP) and sequential and orthogonalized covariance selection (SO-CovSel), were performed to extract the feature information in the two blocks. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) classification algorithm combined with fused matrices was used to identify the geographical origins. The results of PLS-DA models indicated that SO-PLS and SO-CovSel, taking advantage of the sequential modeling coupled to orthogonalization, could not only identify the common information presented in the two blocks but also provide more concise methods without any loss of classification ability, which could be employed in authenticating the geographical regions of the fruits of A. tsao-ko, effectively.

AB Food-grade tracers have been developed as an identification technology for grain traceability from original harvest to final destination for transportation. The characteristics of food-grade tracers must be able to satisfy the environmental demands for grain traceability. To optimize the food-grade tracer production process, the effects of direct compression formulation and load on the mechanical characteristics were studied using response surface methodology (RSM) with central composite design (CCD). Among the four tested formulations, Formulations #2 (consisting of 35.00% lactose 100 mesh, 64.50% microcrystalline cellulose 102 and 0.50% magnesium stearate) and #4 (consisting of 38.00% lactose 100 mesh, 50.00% microcrystalline cellulose 102, 11.00% pregelatinized starch and 1.00% magnesium stearate) were selected for tracer production based on their physical properties as powders. The value of Carr's flowability index was 68 for both Formulations #2 and #4, which was the highest among all the formulations. Therefore, Formulations #2 and #4 also had the best powder flowability. The magnesium stearate ratio (1.00%-3.00%) and pressure (6.00-16.00 kgf) were used as independent variables to detect changes in the breaking rate, peak shear force and friction coefficient of tracers compressed by the selected formulations. The optimal production parameters could be achieved at a magnesium stearate ratio of 2.25% and pressure of 16.00 kgf for Formulation #2 and at a magnesium stearate ratio of 1.02% and pressure of 16.00 kgf for Formulation #4. Under these optimal conditions, the tracers had good impact characteristics (breaking rate), compression characteristics (peak shear force) and frictional characteristics (friction coefficient). Moreover, Formulation #2 was more suitable for production because compared to Formulation #4, its breaking rate and friction coefficient values were lower, and its peak shear force value was higher.

AB BACKGROUND Analytical traceability of PGI and PDO foods (Protected Geographical Indication and Protected Denomination Origin respectively) is one of the most challenging tasks of current applied research. RESULTS Here we proposed a metabolomic approach based on the combination of 1H high-resolution magic angle spinningnuclear magnetic resonance (HRMAS-NMR) spectroscopy with multivariate analysis, i.e. PLS-DA, as a reliable tool for the traceability of Italian PGI chicories (Cichorium intybus L.), i.e. Radicchio Rosso di Treviso and Radicchio Variegato di Castelfranco, also known as red and red-spotted, respectively. The metabolic profile was gained by means of HRMAS-NMR, and multivariate data analysis allowed us to build statistical models capable of providing clear discrimination among the two varieties and classification according to the geographical origin. CONCLUSION Based on Variable Importance in Projection values, the molecular markers for classifying the different types of red chicories analysed were found accounting for both the cultivar and the place of origin.

AB The transition to a circular supply chain is a prerequisite for the agri-food sector to address growing consumer pressure for sustainability while meeting the required standards of quality and safety. Although traceability systems contribute notably to agri-food sustainability, their function as a core mechanism for monitoring and managing the transition from linear to circular supply chains has been neglected. Our objective in this study is to explore the role of traceability in the transition to sustainability-driven circular agri-food supply chains. We employ an end-to-end supply chain investigation, using a consumer-focused survey and a Delphi study of supply chain stakeholders from farm to shelf. Our results suggest that traceability plays a pivotal role in this process. The acceptance of traceability systems begins with the consumer and moves upstream, from fork to farm, acting as a catalyst through stakeholders' adoption towards a circular economy. A change at the consumer level drives changes in the supply chain and eventually at the company level. This study is the first to introduce a traceability angle to the current literature on sustainable agri-food supply chains and its transition to the circular economy.

   Sustainable Tomato
SO FOODS
LA English
DT Article

   sustainability
AB Technological advances result in new traceability configurations that, however, cannot always secure transparency and food safety. Even in cases where a system guarantees transparency, the actual consumer involvement and a real consumer-based perspective cannot always be ensured. The importance of such consumer centricity is vital, since it is strongly associated with effective supply chains that properly fulfil their end-users' needs and requests. Thus, the objective of this paper was to explore the level of consumer centricity in food supply chains under a traceability system. The methodological approach employed a framework of two studies validating subsequently a similar set of variables, using initially consumers data and then supply chain actors data. The supply chain of sustainable tomato was selected to design the studies. The level of agreement between datasets suggested the level of the supply chain consumer centricity. Findings showed health, trust, quality, nutrition, and safety-related values to be significant for the consumers towards accepting a traceability system. The supply chain actors also accepted a traceability system based on the fact that their customers' needs rely on the exact same beliefs, indicating a high level of consumer centricity. The current work underlines the magnitude of consumer centricity in food supply chains and provides an easy and straightforward framework for its exploration. Key implications suggest the design of more effective supply chain and consumer-based strategies for the food industry. Policymakers could also adopt the concept of consumer centricity to further improve the food industry.

AB Food product nutritional and sensory characteristics are often deeply linked to its territory of origin; therefore, its authentication by means of elemental composition becomes crucial for traceability and fighting food fraud. This study aims to establish a fast and reproducible procedure for origin and quality assessment of Sicilian tomato fruits, including PGI "Pomodoro di Pachino", by using the X-ray fluorescence (XRF) technique. Measurements were performed on different parts of PGI Pachino tomatoes belonging to the same production lot. Principal Component and Cluster Analyses show that the samples cluster accordingly with the production lot, disentangling the different parts of the fruit. This procedure, which uses XRF yield elemental pattern and statistical analysis, establishes a solid basis for characterizing elemental profiles by a fast XRF in-situ campaign, supporting the traceability system. The reliability of XRF results was confirmed by comparing elemental concentrations with ICP-MS measurements, performed for comparison, and tomato literature values.

AB BACKGROUND: To protect the features and authenticity of food products, the European Commission enforces two certification labels: Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) and Protected Geographical Indication (PGI). EEC Regulation No. 510/2006 imposes criteria for labelling, production and commercialisation of olive oil. Since plant genotype is a major determinant in establishing the PDO and PGI labels, methods to ascertain the varieties present in a batch of olive oil are essential in validating product conformity. The traceability of olive oil can be assessed through simple sequence repeat (SSR) co-dominant markers targeted to specific regions of DNA from olive cultivars.
   RESULTS: Twenty-one monovarietal olive oils were analysed with nine nuclear and two shortened SSRs. For each marker the correspondence of allelic profile with the reference cultivar, the reproducibility of profiles in different DNA extractions and the polymorphism information content were determined.
   CONCLUSION: The results showed that using a panel of SSR markers such as those described in this paper allows one to make a reliable attribution of an olive oil to a specific cultivar. (C) 2011 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Stable isotope ratios of cattle tail hair were investigated for their potential to classify beef from different regions in China. The delta C-13, delta N-15 and delta H-2 values in 167 cattle tail hair samples from 7 sampling subregions belonging to four beef production regions were measured by IRMS. Variance analysis and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were employed for this purpose. The results showed that significant differences existed in delta C-13, delta N-15 and delta H-2 values of tail hair among different sampling regions. An overall correct classification rate of 82.6% and cross-validation rate of 79.6% were obtained for the four beef production regions based on delta C-13, delta N-15 and delta H-2 values, compared to 70.7% and 70.1% for the seven sampling subregions. These results demonstrated the potential usefulness of stable isotope analysis of cattle tail hair for establishing beef traceability database. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As one of the widely consumed foods, aquatic products are prone to spoilage and deteriorate in the cold chain. It is very important and necessary to trace and track the aquatic products' quality and safety in the cold chain. This paper aims to develop a quality and safety traceability system integrated with wireless sensor network (WSN) and quick response (QR) code (SMS-CQ) for aquatic products. This paper analyzed temperature fluctuations of aquatic products in cold-chain logistics that is implemented and evaluated in an actual cold chain. The results show that compared with the traditional system, SMS-CQ is an effective quality management tool that leads to real-time monitoring and tracing of the aquatic products in the cold chain: WSN technology enables SMS-CQ to automatically realize the real-time temperature acquisition, wireless remote transmission and monitoring; QR code provides valid means for the QR code generation, error correction and static and sensed dynamic information inquiry.

AB The genetic varietal authentication of wine was investigated according to DNA isolation procedures reported for enological matrices and also, by testing 11 commercial extraction kits and various protocol modifications. Samples were collected at different stages of the winemaking process of renowned Italian wines Brunello di Montalcino, Lambruschi Modenesi, and Trento DOC. Results demonstrated not only that grape DNA loss is produced by the fermentation process but also that clarification and stabilization operations contribute to the reduction of double-stranded DNA content on wine. Despite the presence of inhibitors, downstream PCIUgenotyping yielded reliable nuclear and chloroplast SSR markers for must samples, whereas no amplification or inconsistent results were obtained at later stages of the vinification. In addition, a TaqMan genotyping assay based on cultivar-specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was designed, which allowed assessment of grapevine DNA mixtures. Once the wine matrix limitations are overcome, this sensitive tool may be implemented for the relative quantification of cultivars used for blend wines or frauds.

AB Food traceability is increasingly relevant with respect to safety, quality and typicality issues. Lemon fruits grown in a typical lemon-growing area of southern Italy (Siracusa), have been awarded the PGI (Protected Geographical Indication) recognition as 'Limone di Siracusa'. Due to its peculiarity, consumers have an increasing interest about this product. The detection of potential fraud could be improved by using the tools linking the composition of this production to its typical features.
   This study used a wide range of analytical techniques, including conventional techniques and analytical approaches, such as spectral (NIR spectra), multi-elemental (Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Li, Sr) and isotopic (C-13/C-12, O-18/O-16) marker investigations, joined with multivariate statistical analysis, such as PLS-DA (Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis) and LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis), to implement a traceability system to verify the authenticity of 'Limone di Siracusa' production. The results demonstrated a very good geographical discrimination rate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Geographical traceability of Chinese green tea using stable isotope and
   multi-element chemometrics
SO RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY
LA English
DT Article
ID ORIGIN; RATIO; AUTHENTICATION; WINES; RICE; SOIL
AB Rationale: Deliberate and fraudulent origin mislabeling of Chinese green tea motivated by large price differences often brings significant food safety risks and damages consumer trust. Currently, there is no reliable method to verify the origin of green tea produced in China. Stable isotope and multi-element analyses combined with statistical models are widely acknowledged as useful traceability techniques for many agro-products, and could be developed to confirm the geographical origin of Chinese green tea and, more importantly, combat illegal green tea mislabeling and fraud.
   Methods: An analytical strategy combining elemental analyzer/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (EA/IRMS) and inductively plasma coupled mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with chemometrics tools was used to confirm the origin of green tea grown in the main tea production provinces around China. Stable C, N, H,O isotope ratios and twenty elements were measured to build mathematical discriminant models using unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) and supervised linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Two main problems: (i) tracing the origin of Chinese green tea from different tea growing provinces (Zhejiang, Shandong, and other provinces); (ii) authentication of high-value Westlake Longjing tea from the Westlake region and surrounding areas in Zhejiang province, were investigated and assessed.
   Results: The results demonstrated that PCA and follow-up LDA based on stable isotope and multi-element signatures can verify the geographical origin of Chinese green tea from different provinces, and even localized zones in the same province could be distinguishable, with discrimination accuracies higher than 92.3% and 87.8%, respectively.
   Conclusions: Geochemical fingerprinting techniques coupled with chemometric tools offer an accurate and effective verification method for the geographical origin of Chinese green tea, providing a promising tool to combat fraudulent mislabeling of high-value green tea.

AB Food Traceability 4.0 (FT 4.0) is about tracing foods in the era of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) with techniques and technologies reflecting this new revolution. Interest in food traceability has gained momentum in response to, among others events, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, reinforcing the need for digital food traceability that prevents food fraud and provides reliable information about food. This review will briefly summarize the most common conventional methods available to determine food authenticity before highlighting examples of emerging techniques that can be used to combat food fraud and improve food traceability. A particular focus will be on the concept of FT 4.0 and the significant role of digital solutions and other relevant Industry 4.0 innovations in enhancing food traceability. Based on this review, a possible new research topic, namely FT 4.0, is encouraged to take advantage of the rapid digitalization and technological advances occurring in the era of Industry 4.0. The main FT 4.0 enablers are blockchain, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, and big data. Digital technologies in the age of Industry 4.0 have significant potential to improve the way food is traced, decrease food waste and reduce vulnerability to fraud opening new opportunities to achieve smarter food traceability. Although most of these emerging technologies are still under development, it is anticipated that future research will overcome current limitations making large-scale applications possible.

AB Traditional agricultural product traceability system adopts centralized storage, and the traceability process is solidified, which results in the low reliability of traceability results and the poor flexibility of the system. Aiming to solve this problem, blockchain technology is applied to supply chain traceability, and a supply chain traceability system based on sidechain technology is proposed. Goods management, information sharing, and product traceability in supply chain are realized through Ethereum smart contract. The sidechain technology is adopted to expand Ethereum so that it can meet the needs of practical applications. The experiment results show that the proposed system has a transaction function and information sharing function. Compared with similar trading systems, the proposed system has more advantages in throughput and security.

AB For efficient extraction of amplifiable DNA from edible vegetable oils, we developed a novel DNA extraction approach based on the non-silica-based dipolar nanocomposites. The nanoparticle comprises a hydrophilic polymethyl methacrylate core with abundant capillaries, hydrophilic vesicles decorated with molecules having DNA affinity and a coating hydrophobic polystyrene layer. The nanoparticles are soluble in oil, adsorb the DNA from the aqueous phase and gave a high DNA recovery ratio. All DNA extracts from fully refined vegetable oil soybean, peanut, rapeseed, and cottonseed oils, including their blends, were sufficiently pure to be amplified by real-time PCR targeting the chloroplast ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate gene (rbcL), therefore, the species of origin and their ratios in mixed vegetable oils blended from two or three oil-species could be determined. These results indicate that the novel DNA isolation and real-time PCR kit is a simple, sensitive and efficient tool for the species identification and traceability in refined vegetable oils.

ID DISCRIMINATION; QUALITY
AB As the security of agricultural products has become a serious issue faced by people worldwide in recent decades, measures for an effective supervision system for agricultural product quality and safety are continuously being developed. In such a system, the assessment of agricultural product authenticity and geographical origin traceability could play a very important role. Recently, researchers have been focusing on some successful techniques, including the stable isotopic technique, compositional analysis technique, spectroscopic technique, and sensor technology. The benefits from advances made in spectroscopy and imaging technology have facilitated the development of imaging spectrometry techniques that offer such advantages as being nondestructive, rapid, and requiring minimal to no sample preparation. This paper discusses several nondestructive technologies used for the assessment of agricultural product authenticity and geographical origin traceability, with a special focus on the nondestructive technology of imaging using an electromagnetic spectrum for agricultural product safety and quality. It specifically discusses the technology of ultraviolet imaging, hyperspectral imaging, fluorescence spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and terahertz spectroscopy according to different wavelengths and frequency of this electromagnetic spectrum. Although the application of nondestructive measurements performed using the electromagnetic spectrum for identifying agricultural product authenticity and geographical origin traceability is increasing along with advanced technology and lower equipment costs, the accuracy of such measurements must still be improved and the advantages in practical applications need to be determined.

ID REFLECTANCE SPECTRUM; CAROTENOIDS
AB In the Iblei plateau (Sicily, Southern Italy) the native dairy cattle breed Modicana during the spring season grazes exclusively on natural pastures for the production of the Ragusano protected denomination of origin cheese. Along the grazing season, herbage undergoes to changes on protein, fibre and moisture content, affecting quality parameters such as plant carotenoids concentration, involved in the colour and nutritional characteristics of dairy products and potential biomarkers for authenticating fed green pasture-based diets. The aim of this work was to assess whether the cheese traceability index, based on the carotenoids spectra data elaboration, could be related to seasonal variations of floral composition and pasture quality. Four herbage and cheese samples were collected every two weeks in two representative farms of this area, from March to May 2013. Pasture characteristics as pastoral vegetation composition and pastoral value were analysed using the methodology developed for pastoral resources studies. Traceability index showed a significant positive correlation with pasture moisture and crude protein content (r=0.729* and 0.853**, respectively), while it was negatively correlated with fibre content (r=-0.719*).

AB In recent years, an increasing number of typicality marks has been awarded to high-quality olive oils produced from local cultivars. In this case, quality control requires effective varietal checks of the starting materials. Moreover, accurate cultivar identification is essential in vegetative-propagated plants distributed by nurseries and is a pre-requisite to register new cultivars. Food genomics provides many tools for cultivar identification and traceability from tree to oil and table olives. The results of the application of different classes of DNA markers to olive with the purpose of checking cultivar identity and variability of plant material are extensively discussed in this review, with special regard to repeatability issues and polymorphism degree. The characterization of olive germplasm from all countries of the Mediterranean basin and from less studied geographical areas is described and innovative high-throughput molecular tools to manage reference collections are reviewed. Then the transferability of DNA markers to processed products-virgin olive oils and table olives-is overviewed to point out strengths and weaknesses, with special regard to (i) the influence of processing steps and storage time on the quantity and quality of residual DNA, (ii) recent advances to overcome the bottleneck of DNA extraction from processed products, (iii) factors affecting whole comparability of DNA profiles between fresh plant materials and end-products, (iv) drawbacks in the analysis of multi-cultivar versus single-cultivar end-products and (v) the potential of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques.

The tracing and quality information are combined on a web platform to obtain a complete procedure to develop what we define as an "infotracing system". Quality analyses (chemical, sensorial and spectrophotometric) were carried Out on a total of 23 cheese wheels (8 with TAGs) and for three cheese maturation classes (3, 6 or 9 months after production). Two typologies of RFID tags were tested. Results were screened by Partial Least Squares regressions (PLS) on reflectance values for the prediction of chemical content, while classification of cheese maturation classes (3, 6 or 9 months) was carried out by Partial Least Squares.Discriminant Analysis (PLSDA) on reflectance values. The RFID system turned out as effective, reliable and compatible with the production process tool. A good estimation of maturation degree by spectral and chemical analysis was obtained. Moreover an infotracing web-based system was designed to acquire and link basic information that can be made available to the final consumer or to different food chain actors before or after purchasing, using the RFID code to identify the single and specific cheese product. The projected web-based tracing system could improve the products commerce by increasing the information transparency for the consumer. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Traceability and related concepts, such as trust and transparency have gained greatly in relevance in food supply chains. This study seeks to answer what exactly determines firms' investments in traceability systems by developing and testing a theoretical framework using partial least squares methodology and empirical data from 234 companies of the German food industry.
   The results reveal that high external pressure to implement improves the image of tracking and tracing systems in the sense that their use enhances a firm's status, increases the intention to use those systems and fosters their perceived usefulness in the eyes of agribusiness executives. The hypothesized negative effect of costs on perceived usefulness and the intention to invest could not be verified. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Simple Summary
   Domestic livestock diversity is an important component of global biodiversity and molecular data have become essential for the characterization of genetic diversity in cattle. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a 30-short tandem repeat (STR) panel and reveal the genetic structure of a local Pirenaica breed compared with other breeds (Terrena, Blonde d'Aquitaine, Limousin, Salers and Holstein-Friesian) typically raised in the same geographic Basque region. The proposed STR panel could be used as an appropriate genetic tool to trace Pirenaica animals and their Protected Geographic Indication (PGI) products.
   Pirenaica is the most important autochthonous cattle breed within the Protected Geographic Indication (PGI) beef quality label in the Basque region, in northern Spain. The short tandem repeats (STRs) are powerful markers to elucidate forensic cases and traceability across the agri-food sector. The main objective of the present work was to study the phylogenetic relationships of Pirenaica cattle and other breeds typically raised in the region and provide the minimum number of STR markers for parentage and traceability purposes. The 30-STR panel recommended by the International Society of Animal Genetics-Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (ISAG-FAO) was compared against other commercial STR panels. The 30-STR panel showed a combined matching probability of 1.89 x 10(-25) and a power of exclusion for duos of 0.99998. However, commercial STR panels showed a limited efficiency for a reliable parentage analysis in Pirenaica, and at least a 21-STR panel is needed to reach a power of exclusion of 0.9999. Machine-learning analysis also demonstrated a 95% accuracy in assignments selecting the markers with the highest F-ST in Pirenaica individuals. Overall, the present study shows the genetic characterization of Pirenaica and its phylogeny compared with other breeds typically raised in the Basque region. Finally, a 21-STR panel with the highest F-ST markers is proposed for a confident parentage analysis and high traceability.

AB In recent years, the Chinese government has highlighted the importance of adopting hog safety/quality traceability, and a growing amount of research continues to entice firms to adopt traceability systems. In this study, a survey was conducted on a sample of pig slaughtering and processing firms in Zhejiang, China through personal interviews and emails. The aim of this study was to examine the determinants of firm behavior on the implementation of voluntary traceability systems with more stringent standards and controls than those of the mandatory system in China. The results revealed that motivation based on product quality improvement, capital ability and role perception (business type) had significantly positive relationships with a firm's voluntary traceability. Other incentives, such as operation improvement, recall risk reduction, reduced occurrence of safety issues, and technical strength were not found to be supportive in our study. This study provides an opportunity to better understand the determinants of firm behavior on voluntary traceability, particularly in light of the fact that some Chinese firms are facing the threat of criminal action for the use of illegal additives and the abuse of Clenbuterol. Policy recommendations on encouraging the implementation of pork safety voluntary traceability by hog slaughtering and processing firms are also discussed.

AB Medicinal plants have incredibly high economic value, and a practical evaluation of their quality is the key to promoting industry development. The deep learning model based on residual convolutional neural network (ResNet) has the advantage of automatic extraction and the recognition of Fourier transform near-infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIR) features. Models are difficult to understand and interpret because of unknown working mechanisms and decision-making processes. Therefore, in this study, artificial feature extraction methods combine traditional partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and support vector machine (SVM) models to understand and compare deep learning models. The results show that the ResNet model has significant advantages over traditional models in feature extraction and recognition. Secondly, preprocessing has a great impact on the feature extraction and feature extraction, and is beneficial for improving model performance. Competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) and variable importance in projection (VIP) methods screen out more feature variables after preprocessing, but the number of potential variables (LVs) and successive projections algorithm (SPA) methods obtained is fewer. The SPA method only extracts two variables after preprocessing, causing vital information to be lost. The VIP feature of traditional modelling yields the best results among the four methods. After spectral preprocessing, the recognition rates of the PLS-DA and SVM models are up to 90.16% and 88.52%. For the ResNet model, preprocessing is beneficial for extracting and identifying spectral image features. The ResNet model based on synchronous two-dimensional correlation spectra has a recognition accuracy of 100%. This research is beneficial to the application development of the ResNet model in foods, spices, and medicinal plants.

AB H-1 HRMAS-NMR spectroscopy was successfully used to determine the metabolic profiles of 78 tubers obtained from three early genotypes grown under organic and conventional management. The variation in total hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen contents was also assessed. A PLS-DA multivariate statistical analysis provided good discrimination among the varieties and cropping systems (100% unknown samples placed in a cross-validation blind test), suggesting that this method is a powerful and rapid tool for tracing organic potatoes. As a result of the farming system, the nitrogen content decreased by 11-14% in organic tubers, whereas GABA and lysine accumulated in the organic tubers of all clones. Clear variations in primary metabolites are discussed to provide a better understanding of the metabolic pathway modifications resulting from agronomical practices.

AB Letra Q program is the official information system of European Union that allows registration and identification of agents, establishments and containers of dairy sector to improve the traceability of raw milk for human consumption from farm to dairy industry. In this paper, the objective was to analyze Letra Q program functionig in raw sheep milk in the South of Spain (Andalusia). Five process management variables were studied: sample status, sample result (VA: analyzed valid sample; VI: incomplete valid sample, ER: sample in reserve,and RE: rejected sample), time from sample collection to laboratory reception (TT-R), time from sample reception to analysis (TR-A), time total from sampling to analysis (TT-A); as well as four bromatological variables: fat content (G), protein content (P) and lean dry extract (ESM), and cryoscopic point (PC); and finally three hygienic-sanitary variables: somatic cell count (RCS), colony forming number (NFC) and inhibitors presence (PI). A descriptive and comparative statistical analysis on a universe of 7,507 samples belonging to 53 farms was performed. The results showed VA (77.67 +/- 0.54), VI (20.65 +/- 0.53), ER (1.05 +/- 0.01), RE (0.63 +/- 0.01%), TT- R (1.27 +/- 1.82d), TR-A (1.32 +/- 1.67d), TTA (2.53 +/- 1.77d), G (6.98 +/- 0.48 g/100g) , P (5.40 +/- 0.48 g/100g), ESM (12.23 +/- 2.71 g/100g), PC (-0.57 +/- 0.01 degrees C), RCS (971.69 +/- 764.72x103) cells/mL) NFC (121.24 +/- 280.675x103 cells/mL) and PI (0.12 +/- 0.09%). The comparative analysis revealed significant differences in management variables for factors year and type of laboratory, as well as differences for bromatological and hygienic-sanitary variables between farm size and breed type. It is concluded that Letter Q program contributes to guarantee food innocuousness in consumers and constitutes a tool of great interest for the management and improvement of information in dairy sector.

AB Fish meal is a kind of high-protein feed made up of one or more kinds of fish, which occupies a very important position in the aquaculture industry. In order to maintain market order, a method of tracing the origin of the fish meal should be established to identify and analyze the quality of the fish meal more accurately. In this paper, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and chemometrics are used to trace the origin of fish meal from different habitats quickly and accurately. The support vector machine with radial basis function (RBF-SVM) as the kernel function is used for pattern recognition, and the gray wolf algorithm is used to select the key parameters of RBF-SVM. By simulating the hunting behavior of wolves, a hierarchical system is set up according to the fitness level. The target parameters gradually approximate the movement of encirclement. After each movement, the adaptability is re-evaluated. The prey is finally captured through the iteration of wolf pack rank, and the optimal penalty factor and the radius of the kernel function are searched. Finally, the optimal parameters are used to establish the support vector machine model to trace the origin of fish meal from different origins. Grey Wolf algorithm can improve the speed and accuracy of selecting key parameters in the support vector machine algorithm, and improve the classification accuracy of support vector machine. In this paper, 144 spectra of fish meal samples from four fishmeal producing areas in ZhejiangWenling, Shandong Rongcheng, Shandong Weihai and Liaoning Dalian were obtained. The spectrum ranges from 3700 to 12500 cm(-1). The origin of fish meal was traced by the obtained spectra. Seventy percent of the samples from each producing area was randomly selected as the training sample set for modeling and 30 percent as the test sample set. First, the original near infrared spectra are pretreated, and the average spectra of all the collected spectra are calculated by multivariate scattering correction as "ideal spectra". The other spectra are linearly regressed, and the baseline correction of spectral translation and migration is carried out. The original signal is decomposed by wavelet transform, and the high-frequency signal is thresholded to eliminate the high-frequency noise so as to achieve the smooth denoising effect of the spectral curve. Ten parallel experiments were carried out by support vector machine to reduce error interference, and the classification results were obtained as follows: Zhejiang Wenling, Shandong Rongcheng, Shandong Weihai and Liaoning Dalian were 100% 98.89% 96.43% and 97.78% respectively. Compared with the grid search method, the Improved Grey Wolf algorithm searches for the penalty factor and the radius of the kernel function faster and more accurately, and the classification accuracy is high. It can be seen that the improved grey wolf algorithm's support vector machine (GWO-SVM) is feasible for tracing the origin of fish meal.

AB The objective of this study was to determine the differences in the behaviour and perception of consumers from three regions in Spain with different levels of Iberian ham consumption (high, medium and low) on the attributes related to traceability and differentiated quality certifications. The study was carried out with a sample of 1501 consumers using an online questionnaire in which respondents were asked about their consumption habits regarding cured products and a choice experiment for Iberian ham was performed. The results showed that consumers give greater utility to the attributes of mandatory certification established for Iberian products (quality standards) and to the price, followed by nonmandatory quality certifications (organic, animal welfare, carbon footprint, and PDO). Specifically, animal welfare certification has been the most valued in all areas, especially in the areas with the lowest consumption.

AB Objective: Increasing food safety demands in the animal product market have created a need for a system to trace the food distribution process, from the manufacturer to the retailer, and genetic traceability is an effective method to trace the origin of animal products. In this study, we successfully achieved the farm tracing of 6,018 multi-breed pigs, using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers strictly selected through least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) feature selection.
   Methods: We performed farm tracing of domesticated pig (Sus scrofa) from SNP markers and selected the most relevant features for accurate prediction. Considering multi-breed composition of our data, we performed feature selection using LASSO penalization on 4,002 SNPs that are shared between breeds, which also includes 179 SNPs with small between-breed difference. The 100 highest-scored features were extracted from iterative simulations and then evaluated using machine-leaning based classifiers.
   Results: We selected 1,341 SNPs from over 45,000 SNPs through iterative LASSO feature selection, to minimize between-breed differences. We subsequently selected 100 highest-scored SNPs from iterative scoring, and observed high statistical measures in classification of breeding farms by cross-validation only using these SNPs.
   Conclusion: The study represents a successful application of LASSO feature selection on multibreed pig SNP data to trace the farm information, which provides a valuable method and possibility for further researches on genetic traceability.

AB Background Eucommia ulmoides leaf (EUL), as a medicine and food homology plant, is a high-quality industrial raw material with great development potential for a valuable economic crop. There are many factors affecting the quality of EULs, such as different drying methods and regions. Therefore, quality and safety have received worldwide attention, and there is a trend to identify medicinal plants with artificial intelligence technology. In this study, we attempted to evaluate the comparison and differentiation for different drying methods and geographical traceability of EULs. As a superior strategy, the two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS) was used to directly combined with residual neural network (ResNet) based on Fourier transform near-infrared spectroscopy. Results (1) Each category samples from different regions could be clustered together better than different drying methods through exploratory analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis; (2) A total of 3204 2DCOS images were obtained, synchronous 2DCOS was more suitable for the identification and analysis of EULs compared with asynchronous 2DCOS and integrated 2DCOS; (3) The superior ResNet model about synchronous 2DCOS used to identify different drying method and regions of EULs than the partial least squares discriminant model that the accuracy of train set, test set, and external verification was 100%; (4) The Xinjiang samples was significant differences than others with correlation analysis of 19 climate data and different regions. Conclusions This study verifies the superiority of the ResNet model to identify through this example, which provides a practical reference for related research on other medicinal plants or fungus.

AB Traceability and auditability are key structures in supply chain management and construction. However, trust is the most important aspect of customers in these systems. Also, relying on third parties to trade in centralized systems is indispensable. Although current exist frameworks for these solutions in the supply chain, these have work poor traceability and lack of real-time information, and especially lack of privacy. In this article, we propose a framework for supply chain traceability that preserves privacy from third parties by using smart contracts. In the proposed framework, digital signature and verification are provided by using existing cryptographic techniques in off-chain and on-chain smart contract integration, and it is demonstrated the applicability of architecture by testing. The architecture also provides both anonymity and traceability depending on the user's request. Finally, thanks to traceability and auditability in the proposed system, customers and other parties can view with a single product ID and also verify with digital signature the claims of the actors in the system.

AB BACKGROUNDGeographical origin traceability is an important issue for controlling the quality of seafood and safeguarding the interest of consumers. In the present study, a new method of compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) of fatty acids was established to evaluate its applicability in establishing the origin traceability of Apostichopus japonicus in the coastal areas of China. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant analysis (DA) were applied to distinguish between the origins of A. japonicus.
   RESULTSThe results show that the stable carbon isotope compositions of fatty acids of A. japonicus significantly differ in terms of both season and origin. They also indicate that the stable carbon isotope composition of fatty acids could effectively discriminate between the origins of A. japonicus, except for between Changhai Island and Zhangzi Island in the spring of 2016 because of geographical proximity or the similarity of food sources. The fatty acids that have the highest contribution to identifying the geographical origins of A. japonicus are C22:6n-3, C16:1n-7, C20:5n-3, C18:0 and C23:1n-9, when considering the fatty acid contents, the stable carbon isotope composition of fatty acids and the results of the PCA and DA.
   CONCLUSIONSWe conclude that CSIA of fatty acids, combined with multivariate statistical analysis such as PCA and DA, may be an effective tool for establishing the traceability of A. japonicus in the coastal areas of China. The relevant conclusions of the present study provide a new method for determining the traceability of seafood or other food products. (c) 2017 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Food safety is a very important topic in China. We investigate Chinese consumers' preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) for food traceability using a choice experiment. Given that consumers' trust in the food system may affect their preferences and WTP, we also assess the interaction between consumers' trust in government's supervision of food safety and food labels and consumers' preferences for traceable food products. Using data collected from a choice experiment on Fuji apples in a face-to-face survey in six Chinese cities, the results show that (i) consumers are willing to pay for traceable food but their valuations can differ upon the degree of their trust in government's supervision of food safety and food labels; (ii) consumers are willing to pay for traceability with strong evidence of preference heterogeneity; (iii) government is not the most trusted safety inspection and certificate authority as found in prior studies using animal food products in China.

AB BACKGROUND Multi-elements have been widely used to identify the geographical origins of various agricultural products. The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of identifying the geographical origins of peanut kernels at different regional scales by using the multi-element fingerprinting technique. The concentrations of 20 elements [boron (B), magnesium (Mg), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), etc.] were determined in 135 peanut samples from Jilin Province, Jiangsu Province, and Shandong Province of China. Data obtained were processed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), principal components analysis (PCA), k nearest neighbors (k-NN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and support vector machine (SVM).
   RESULTS Peanut kernels from different regions had their own element fingerprints. The k-NN, LDA, and SVM were all suitable to predict peanut kernels according to their grown provinces with the total correct classification rates of 91.2%, 91.1%, and 91.1%, respectively. While SVM was the best to identify different grown cities of peanut kernels with the prediction accuracy of 91.3%, compared to 72.2% and 78.3% for k-NN and LDA, respectively.
   CONCLUSION It was an effective method to identify producing areas of peanut kernels at different regional scales using multi-element fingerprinting combined with SVM to enhance regional capabilities for quality assurance and control. (c) 2020 Society of Chemical Industry

AB High-value agricultural products are characterized by the geographical conditions of the production areas such as climatic and soil conditions. These products are protected by the geographical indication (GI) protection system, which has been introduced in more than 100 countries. Because GI products are expensive in the market, products are often mislabeled as GI. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of analytical methods that enable the tracing of geographical origins of food materials. Stable isotope analysis is used to trace the geographical origin of food materials. In this study, we review the applications for tracing the geographical origin of agricultural products (especially rice, beef, and honey) focusing on an analytical method for analyzing stable isotopes (delta D, delta C-13, delta N-15, delta O-18, and delta S-34).

AB Poria originated from the dried sclerotium of Macrohyporia cocos is an edible traditional Chinese medicine with high economic value. Due to the significant difference in quality between wild and cultivated M. cocos, this study aimed to trace the origin of the fungus from the perspectives of wild and cultivation. In addition, there were quite limited studies about data fusion, a potential strategy, employed and discussed in the geographical traceability of M. cocos. Therefore, we traced the origin of M. cocos from the perspectives of wild and cultivation using multiple data fusion approaches. Supervised pattern recognition techniques, like partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and random forest, were employed in this study using. Five types of data fusion involving low-, mid-, and high-level data fusion strategies were performed. Two feature extraction approaches including the selecting variables by a random forest-based method-Boruta algorithm and producing principal components by the dimension reduction technique of principal component analysis-were considered in data fusion. The results indicate the following: (1) The difference between wild and cultivated samples did exist in terms of the content analysis of vital chemical components and fingerprint analysis. (2) Wild samples need data fusion to realize the origin traceability, and the accuracy of the validation set was 95.24%. (3) Boruta outperformed principal component analysis (PCA) in feature extraction. (4) The mid-level Boruta PLS-DA model took full advantage of information synergy and showed the best performance. This study proved that both geographical traceability and optimal identification methods of cultivated and wild samples were different, and data fusion was a potential technique in the geographical identification.

AB In the food supply chain, quality control has a very important role in maintaining customer confidence. In the EU, food safety aspects are strictly regulated; however, composition requirements and standard control methods are generally undefined. The rapidly increasing wild boar population has a growing market share in venison or game meat production. Several methods have been described for species identification and control of composition in food products, but only some of these are suitable for routine measurements. The aim of our research was to design a rapid, reliable and simple PCR insertion/deletion (InDel)-based genetic tool suitable for species identification in food quality control laboratories. In total, 59 different swine (Sus scrofa) whole genomes were tested with bioinformatic tools to identify wild boar-specific insertions or deletions. Three independent InDels were suitable for marker development, multiplex PCR amplification and separation in agarose gel. Altogether, 209 samples of wild boar and ten other domestic pig breeds were taken for DNA extraction and validation of the three multiplexed InDel markers. Statistical analysis showed a very high combined predictive value (0.996), indicating the capability of the newly developed markers to detect wild boars with a probability over 99%. Breed assignment tests confirm that the InDel markers developed are suitable for rapid, sensitive and reliable identification of the wild boar meat content of food products. The use of the reported method in food quality control can mean a simple and cost-effective way to maintain consumer confidence and to support the competitiveness of fair producers.

AB The olive tree is one of the most common fruit species cultivated for oil and table olives in Italy and, particularly, in the Mediterranean area. DNA fingerprinting methods include different markers; however, our work is based on the identification of olive oil cultivars by using simple sequence repeats analysis. As previously reported in the literature, this proposed method shows good capability to amplify, for example, DNA from wine and table grape varieties. In our paper, we suggest an easy methodology, which allows direct amplification of DNA and bypassing of the extraction of DNA using an engineered DNA polymerase, KAPA3G Plant DNA polymerase, improved to tolerate plant PCR inhibitors. This new procedure is more efficient, faster and cheaper than traditional methods of DNA extraction and amplification and leads to more accurate results. This innovative protocol, without the addition of chemical solutions, has provided good results and has permitted traceability of virgin olive oils.

AB In this work, a commercial energy dispersion X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) spectrometer was utilized to measure the trace elements in soybean samples. After optimizing the radiation time and calibration strategy, ED-XRF was able to successfully measure 9 elements (Mg, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Rb) in 296 soybean samples from five producing areas of northern China (Henan, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Heilongjiang, and Liaoning). Since principal component analysis (PCA) is not able to distinguish all growing areas completely, the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) procedure was employed which demonstrated to have a powerful classification capacity with an accuracy rate of 96.2%. XRF is a type of solid sampling analytical method, which is fast, accurate and partly portable for multi-elemental analysis. The combination of MLP and ED-XRF overcomes the analytical disadvantages found with ICP-MS or wavelength dispersion XRF analysis, and provides a novel and fast testing method for on-site recognition of food origin traceability.

AB In response to increasing concerns about domestic food safety issues, establishing tracking systems in the food industry is mandatorily required under newly launched food safety laws. However, the kinds of monitoring and certification systems that should be set up to ensure practical adoption and the effectiveness of the regulation remain unclear. This study aims to analyze consumers' preferences for milk traceability, with particular interest in investigating how consumers' preferences could be affected by monitoring and certification systems of the regarding system. Survey data from a choice-based conjoint (CBC) experiment are used to achieve this objective. In the experiment, milk is defined by a set of attributes in which we assume that milk traceability can be certified by three entities: the government, an industrial association, and a third party. The CBC data are then analyzed by using the alternative-specific form of a conditional Logit (McFadden's Choice) model. We found that urban Chinese consumers have a strong desire for traceable milk, but their preference for traceable milk is significantly related to the associated certificate issuers. Currently, the highest willingness-to-pay goes to government certificated traceable milk, followed by industrial association certificated and third-party certificated milks. In the future, however, consumers are likely to give more credit to third-party certification with rising income and knowledge.

AB Near infrared spectra of 99 lamb meat samples from three pasturing areas and two farming areas of China were scanned and analyzed to seek a cheap, rapid and effective method for lamb meat origin traceability. Two chemometric methods including linear discriminant analysis based on principal component analysis (PCA+LDA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were used to develop the discriminate models. It was showed that there were significantly differences among the lamb meat samples from five regions based on NIR spectra after second derivative (Savitzky-Golay, 9 point) and multiplicative scattering correction(MSC) transformation in the whole wavelength. The discrimination of two models was best for classification of pasturing area and farming area, with both correctly classified by 100%. The correct classification rate of samples from five different regions using PCA-FLDA model was 91. 2%, higher than using PLS-DA model (76. 7%). These results demonstrate that near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) combined with chemometric analysis can be used as an effective method to classify lamb meat according to its geographical origin.

TI BCST-APTS: Blockchain and CP-ABE Empowered Data Supervision, Sharing,

   Product Traceability System
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
LA English
DT Article
AB Blockchain provides new technologies and ideas for the construction of agricultural product traceability system (APTS). However, if data is stored, supervised, and distributed on a multiparty equal blockchain, it will face major security risks, such as data privacy leakage, unauthorized access, and trust issues. How to protect the privacy of shared data has become a key factor restricting the implementation of this technology. We propose a secure and trusted agricultural product traceability system (BCST-APTS), which is supported by blockchain and CP-ABE encryption technology. It can set access control policies through data attributes and encrypt data on the blockchain. This can not only ensure the confidentiality of the data stored in the blockchain, but also set flexible access control policies for the data. In addition, a whole-chain attribute management infrastructure has been constructed, which can provide personalized attribute encryption services. Furthermore, a reencryption scheme based on ciphertext-policy attribute encryption (RE-CP-ABE) is proposed, which can meet the needs of efficient supervision and sharing of ciphertext data. Finally, the system architecture of the BCST-APTS is designed to successfully solve the problems of mutual trust, privacy protection, fine-grained, and personalized access control between all parties.

AB The adulteration of olive oils based on advanced sensors has attracted high interest owing to its health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain pathologies. Concerning its health and commercial aspects, lower grade oil blending and other illegal additives in virgin olive oil can negatively affect the nutritive value of olive oil. This review focuses on the advances in the sensing and identification of adulteration of olive oil. Optical sensing, chromatography (usually coupled with mass spectrometry), and nuclear magnetic resonance are discussed in detail. Other methods including a DNA-based method, dielectric spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis and electronic nose among others, are overviewed as well.

TI VERIFICATION OF SHEEP IDENTITY BY MEANS OF A RETINAL RECOGNITION SYSTEM
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE
LA English
DT Article
DE Biometrics; Electronic identification; Retina; Sheep; Traceability
AB In January 2010, electronic identification of sheep was introduced within the European Union. This article presents an alternative method of verification of sheep identity. Current identification protocols implement a system in which the tag number is traced throughout the traceability system and not the animal; this can lead to misidentification and the possibility of tampering with identifiers. Retinal identification offers a non-invasive, accurate, and tamper-proof method of identification in which the retinal vascular patterns of both eyes are recorded for identification. There are more than 200 distinct breeds of sheep worldwide, so it is important to determine if breed affects the retinal image matching performance as a result of different eye physiology, such as the amount of myelinization (dark pigmentation present on the ocular fundus) that forms within the retinal vascular area that is examined for identification. A previous study determined that the best condition in which to achieve optimum quality retinal images was indoors; therefore, all the retinal images in this experiment were collected indoors. This study sets out the matching score criteria that are required to successfully implement retinal imaging as a viable method of sheep identification. The objectives of this study were to examine the effects of breed and age of sheep on the matching scores recorded and to set a matching score decision criterion for a retinal imaging system. A representative sample (n = 160) of four breeds of sheep (Cheviot, Charollais, Suffolk, and Texel) categorized into two age groups (<= 2 years and >2 years) were examined. A non-parametric statistical analysis of matching scores showed that there was no observable effect of breed (p = 0.209) or age category (p = 0.181) on the matching performance. The recognition performance of a single-eye retinal system (either the left or right eye retinal image was used for identity) was estimated to have a false match error of 0.43% and a false non-match error of 0.96% at a matching score threshold of 75 when sheep retinal images were obtained indoors. When the recognition system was based on the two retinas, the false non-match rate achieved was 2.66 x 10(-7), or approximately one false non-match in 3.7 million matching attempts.

AB This is the first work to introduce the use of blockchain technology for the electronic traceability of wood from standing tree to final user. Infotracing integrates the information related to the product quality with those related to the traceability [physical and digital documents (Radio Frequency IDentification-RFID-architecture)] within an online information system whose steps (transactions) can be made safe to evidence of alteration through the blockchain. This is a decentralized and distributed ledger that keeps records of digital transactions in such a way that makes them accessible and visible to multiple participants in a network while keeping them secure without the need of a centralized certification organism. This work implements a blockchain architecture within the wood chain electronic traceability. The infotracing system is based on RFID sensors and open source technology. The entire forest wood supply chain was simulated from standing trees to the final product passing through tree cutting and sawmill process. Different kinds of Internet of Things (IoT) open source devices and tags were used, and a specific app aiming the forest operations was engineered to collect and store in a centralized database information (e.g., species, date, position, dendrometric and commercial information).

AB Food-labelling regulations require that meat species in food and feed are accurately declared to the consumer. Traceability systems based on species identification through DNA analysis are potent tools for the supervision of food adulteration. In this study, a TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay targeting a short mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene fragment of 73 base pair (bp) was developed for detection of horse DNA in different commercial meat products for human and pet consumption. The method was found to be specific for horse and did not show any cross-reactivity with different species of mammals, birds, fish and plants. The assay complies with the acceptance criteria required for real-time PCR methods in terms of applicability, linear dynamic range, accuracy and PCR efficiency and showed to be sensitive allowing the detection of 1 pg of horse DNA. A range of food and feed products (n = 171) was screened with the horse-specific real-time PCR to determine whether a correct labelling had been employed at the market level. Results obtained when testing the meat products for human consumption were in agreement with the labelling description provided by the suppliers. In the case of the pet foods, undeclared horse meat was detected in 21 % of the samples at low levels, suggesting unintentional cross-contamination during processing. The reported real-time PCR methodology may represent a suitable tool for the detection of food mislabelling.

AB This study, evaluated the readability of electronic leg and ear tags in Saanen goats. Fifty-seven goats were identified with the electronic leg tap (ELT) and electronic ear tags (EET) from birth until the lactation period ends. Readability of FIT and EET was %.30% and 90.55% respectively in static conditions at the end of 12 months. Foot and udder, with no infection rates for ELI and EET in calm and aggressive goats were 95.70% and 100%, respectively. No infection rates of foot and udder for ELI and EET in calm and aggressive goats were 95.70% and 100%, respectively. Tagging method and animal temperament was not statistically significant. As a result, low animal traceability with ear tags was determined by this study. Besides, it is suggested that smaller-sized tagging materials would be more accurate when the ankle was selected as a body area to place identification tags in goats. The resulting issue to be considered is that the leg tagging should not negatively affect the animal welfare and the foot and udder health. In the future, using a leg band in the identification of goats will become more widespread as it does not damage animals and has a high readability capacity.

AB Purpose Traceability is an increasingly important tool for reducing food safety risks and managing supply logistics. Given the costs of implementing and maintaining traceability systems, it is crucial to understand consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for traceable products. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a scoping review to collate the existing literature on consumer WTP for traceability in food products to determine the nature of the evidence base and to identify research gaps. Findings A total of 77 articles were included in the review. The number of studies published per year generally increased over the review period, and China and the United States were the most common countries in which studies were conducted (43.6 and 14.1% of total studies, respectively). All but one of the studies investigated at least one factor that might influence consumer WTP for traceability, the most common of which was socio-demographic characteristics (72.7%). Three-quarters of studies used hypothetical methods to elicit WTP values (75.3%), whereas one-quarter used non-hypothetical methods (24.7%). Most studies included some measure of preference heterogeneity (83.1%). Research limitations/implications There is some potential for systematic bias in the evidence due to the predominance of studies from only a few countries and the possible presence of hypothetical bias. These potential biases could be corrected through future research. Originality/value To the authors' knowledge, no previous study systematically and comprehensively identifies and summarizes the evidence base on consumer WTP for traceable food products.

AB Recently, soybean oil has become the most consumed genetically modified (GM) vegetable oil globally. To monitor products derived from GM sources, DNA-based analysis methods are being widely adopted, particularly to control the authenticity of several food products including oil. Considering that DNA isolation from foodstuffs is the first step in the detection of GM organisms, we compared five different methods to extract high quality DNA from refined soybean oil. We used ultraviolet spectrophotometry, nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and real-time PCR to evaluate DNA yield and purity, and the sensitivity of the optimized method was evaluated. According to our results, the most effective DNA extraction method was the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-NucleoSpin Food Kit method. Using this method, 21-225 DNA copies were isolated from 1 mL soybean or blended oils, and the minimum ratio of soybean oil that could be detected from a mixture of soybean and peanut oil was 5%. To summarize, we report a novel method that combines pre-concentrating oils and commercial kits. This optimized DNA extraction method advances the traceability of soybean oils for authenticity issues and transgenic detection.

AB In this work, the data fusion strategy of Fourier transform mid infrared (FT-MIR) spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) was used in combination with Support Vector Machine (SVM) to determine the geographic origin of Boletus edulis collected from nine regions of Yunnan Province in China. Firstly, competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) was used for selecting an optimal combination of key wavenumbers of second derivative FT-MIR spectra, and thirteen elements were sorted with variable importance in projection (VIP) scores. Secondly, thirteen subsets of multi-elements with the best VIP score were generated and each subset was used to fuse with FT-MIR Finally, the classification models were established by SVM, and the combination of parameter C and gamma (gamma) of SVM models was calculated by the approaches of grid search (GS) and genetic algorithm (GA). The results showed that both GS-SVM and GA-SVM models achieved good performances based on the #9 subset and the prediction accuracy in calibration and validation sets of the two models were 81.40% and 90.91%, correspondingly. In conclusion, it indicated that the data fusion strategy of FT-MIR and ICP-AES coupled with the algorithm of SVM can be used as a reliable tool for accurate identification of B. edulis, and it can provide a useful way of thinking for the quality control of edible mushrooms.

AB Several socio-economic problems have been hidden by the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Particularly, the agricultural and food industrial sectors have been harshly affected by this devastating disease. Moreover, with the worldwide population increase and the agricultural production technologies being inefficient or obsolete, there is a great need to find new and successful ways to fulfill the increasing food demand. A new era of agriculture and food industry is forthcoming, with revolutionary concepts, processes and technologies, referred to as Agri-food 4.0, which enables the next level of agri-food production and trade. In addition, consumers are becoming more and more aware about the origin, traceability, healthy and high-quality of agri-food products. The integration of new process of production and data management is a mandatory step to meet consumer and market requirements. DNA traceability may provide strong approach to certify and authenticate healthy food products, particularly for olive oil. With this approach, the origin and authenticity of products are confirmed by the means of unique nucleic acid sequences. Selected tools, methods and technologies involved in and contributing to the advance of the agri-food sector are presented and discussed in this paper. Moreover, the application of DNA traceability as an innovative approach to authenticate olive products is reported in this paper as an application and promising case of smart agriculture.

AB The feasibility of using GS1 DataMatrix (GS1 DM) barcodes laser printed onto the beaks of poultry as a possible method of identification and, therefore, traceability of the individual were examined in this study, including a preliminary live trial on layer hens. The optimal laser type and settings for this particular application had been selected during previous in vitro and in vivo trials. GS1 DM barcodes were printed on both sides of the beaks of mature layer hens and read using a high specification camera based 1-Dimensional/2-Dimensional (1-D/2-D) DataMan 7500 barcode reader. The reading procedure was repeated on a number of occasions over a 5 week period to examine the effects of time in a commercial environment on the clarity and readability of the GS1 DM barcode, and the ability of the printed GS1 DM barcodes to resist the physical and chemical challenges of such a setting. The results show a very short timeframe during which all barcodes, both right and left combined, remain readable. Thereafter the readability deteriorates rapidly, due to the growth and healing of the beaks of the layer hens. Results also show that there was no significant difference in the readability between GS1 DM barcodes printed on the right or left side of the beak. The proportion of identification ( i) (i.e. number of layers identifiable by either one or two readable GS1 DM barcodes) was also calculated. All layer hens were fully identifiable for a seven day period by either one or two readable GS1 DM barcodes. Further analysis showed that the proportion of identification (,)was significantly higher for layer hens when identified with two GS1 DM barcodes as opposed to just one. Secure movement control of live mature poultry at vulnerable points in the food chain, such as transfer of ownership, could well be facilitated by the use of this technology, thereby preventing fraud or substitution at these points.

AB Increasingly, blockchain technology is attracting significant attentions in various agricultural applications. These applications could satisfy the diverse needs in the ecosystem of agricultural products, e.g., increasing transparency of food safety and IoT based food quality control, provenance traceability, improvement of contract exchanges, and transactions efficiency. As multiple untrusted parties, including small-scale farmers, food processors, logistic companies, distributors and retailers, are involved into the complex farm-to-fork pipeline, it becomes vital to achieve optimal trade-off between efficiency and integrity of the agricultural management systems as required in contexts. In this paper, we provide a survey to study both techniques and applications of blockchain technology used in the agricultural sector. First, the technical elements, including data structure, cryptographic methods, and consensus mechanisms are explained in detail. Secondly, the existing agricultural blockchain applications are categorized and reviewed to demonstrate the use of the blockchain techniques. In addition, the popular platforms and smart contract are provided to show how practitioners use them to develop these agricultural applications. Thirdly, we identify the key challenges in many prospective agricultural systems, and discuss the efforts and potential solutions to tackle these problems. Further, we conduct an improved food supply chain in the post COVID-19 pandemic economy as an illustration to demonstrate an effective use of blockchain technology.

AB In recent years, isotopic analysis has been proven a valuable tool for the determination of the origin of various materials. In this article, we studied the O-18 and C-13 isotopic values of 210 olive oil samples that were originated from different regions in Greece in order to verify how these values are affected by the climate regime. We observed that the delta O-18 isotopic values range from 19.2 parts per thousand to 25.2 parts per thousand and the delta C-13 values range from -32.7 parts per thousand to -28.3 parts per thousand. These differences between the olive oils' isotopic values depended on the regional temperature, the meteoric water, and the distance from the sea. Furthermore, we studied the C-13 isotopic values of biophenolic extracts, and we observed that they have same capability to differentiate the geographic origin. Finally, we compared the isotopic values of Greek olive oils with samples from Italy, and we concluded that there is a great dependence of oxygen isotopes on the climatic characteristics of the different geographical areas.

AB Fishmeal is a kind of high protein feed material which plays an important role in aquaculture. There is a great market demand for fishmeal in China, but the quality of fishmeal from different places is different. In order to ensure the quality and safety of fishmeal, it is very important to establish a traceability system of fishmeal origin. The energy dispersion X-ray fluorescence spectrum is able to detect the type and content of mineral elements in the sample depending on the energy of the element's radiation X-ray fluorescent photons. The types and contents of mineral elements contained in fishmeal may vary depending on the origin of fishmeal, so this paper proposes for the first time to use the energy dispersion X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (EDXRF) method to scan the fishmeal to obtain the element information of fishmeal elements. After preprocessing the original spectrum, whale optimization algorithm is used to improve the adaptive net analyte signal weight K_lacal hyperplane method can identify the spectrum vector of fishmeal samples, and then identify the origin of fishmeal samples. Firstly, 51 fishmeal samples from Liaoning and Zhejiang were pressed, and different filters were set in the detection program of EDXRF spectrometer, 51 groups (6 spectra in each group) of spectra were obtained. Then the spectrum is preprocessed, and the baseline is corrected based on the adaptive iterative reweighted penalty least squares algorithm (airPLS) so as to eliminate the impact of baseline drift and improve the accuracy. Wavelet transform is used to smooth the spectrum and remove the high-frequency noise of the spectrum curve. The 16-dimensional vector representing the element content of each fishmeal sample was obtained by calculating the peak area of six effective spectral regions. Finally, whale optimization algorithm is used to select the key parameters (neighbor number, principal component fraction, adjustment parameter) of the adaptive net analyte signal weight K_local hyperplane (ANWKH) method, and then the adaptive net analyte signal weight K_local hyperplane model is established by using the found optimal parameters. 70% of the fishmeal samples from each place of origin are selected as the training set, 30% as the test set to identify the fishmeal place of origin. Fishmeal samples are from Liaoning and Zhejiang provinces. The accuracy of the prediction model is 94.3% and 100% respectively. The total accuracy is 97.3%, which is higher than the accuracy of the adaptive net analyte signal weight K_local hyperplane classification. The results show that the method based on energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrum can accurately realize the origin traceability of fishmeal, and the adaptive net analyte signal weight K_local hyperplane method improved by whale optimization algorithm can find the optimal parameters and establish a model with higher classification accuracy. This paper provides a reference for more detailed origin traceability of fishmeal at home and abroad in the future.

AB Xinjiang muskmelon is a popular fruit in China that is exported worldwide. In particular, Hami muskmelon is classified as a protected geographical indication (PGI) product, and consequently it is more desirable and sells at a higher market price than products from other regions. Origin mislabeling and fraudulent substitution of Hami PGI muskmelon products by non-PGI products are frequently reported, which damages its reputation and market advantage. In this study, the geographical origin of muskmelon from Xinjiang was investigated using stable isotopes and multi-element analyses with chemometrics. Four stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15, delta H-2, delta O-18) and seventeen elemental contents (Na, Al, P, K, Ca, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, As, Sr, Mo, Cd, Sb, Ba, Pb) of 239 batches of muskmelon were collected from 13 administrative regions distributed across Xinjiang Province. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare these regional differences using stable isotopes and multi-elements, and showed that a single variable could not fully classify all sample origins. A multivariate model was developed using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) based on stable isotope and multi-element data. The discriminant accuracies of 13 localities across Xinjiang Province was unsatisfactory with values as low as 46.2 % for Changji. Muskmelon from Kashi were misclassified as Aksu (20 %) and Bazhou (16.7 %) respectively. Further LDA modeling was undertaken after the 13 administrative regions were reduced to 6 geographical production regions from Xinjiang. Classification accuracies improved significantly; 100 % for Altay, 91.9 % for Hami and more than 79.1 % for other regions. Therefore, this strategy may be a useful and complementary tool to combat origin mislabeling of Hami PGI muskmelons from other Xinjiang regions, effectively ensuring food integrity and promoting origin certainty of PGI Hami muskmelon from Xinjiang.

AB Food and feed traceability has become a priority for governments due to consumer demand for comprehensive and integrated safety policies. In the present work, a TaqMan real-time PCR assay targeting the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene was developed for specific detection of rabbit and hare material in animal feeds and pet foods. The technique is based on the use of three species-specific primer/probe detection systems targeting three 12S rRNA gene fragments: one from rabbit species, another one from hare species and a third fragment common to rabbit and hare (62, 102 and 75bp length, respectively). A nuclear 18S rRNA PCR system, detecting a 77-bp amplicon, was used as positive amplification control. Assay performance and sensitivity were assessed through the analysis of a batch of laboratory-scale feeds treated at 133 degrees C at 3 bar for 20min to reproduce feed processing conditions dictated by European regulations. Successful detection of highly degraded rabbit and hare material was achieved at the lowest target concentration assayed (0.1%). Furthermore, the method was applied to 96 processed commercial pet food products to determine whether correct labelling had been used at the market level. The reported real-time PCR technique detected the presence of rabbit tissues in 80 of the 96 samples analysed (83.3%), indicating a possible labelling fraud in some pet foods. The real-time PCR method reported may be a useful tool for traceability purposes within the framework of feed control.

ID ANIMAL IDENTIFICATION; TRACEABILITY; MARKERS
AB Context. Genomic profiles are the only information source that can uniquely identify an individual but have not yet been strongly considered in the context of paddock to plate traceability due to the lack of value proposition.
   Aim. The aim of this study was to define the minimum number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) required to distinguish a unique genotype profile for each individual sample within a large given population. At the same time, ad hoc approaches were explored to reduce SNP density, and therefore, the size of the dataset to improve computing efficiency and storage requirements while maintaining informativeness to distinguish individuals.
   Methods. Data for this study included two datasets. One included 78 411 high-density SNP genotypes from commercial Angus cattle and the other 2107 from a research data (1000-bull genome data). In a stepwise approach, different-size SNP panels were explored, with the last step being a successive removal resulting in the smallest set of SNPs that still produced the maximum number of unique genotypes.
   Key results. First study that has demonstrated for large datasets, that ultra-small SNP panels with 20-23 SNPs can generate unique genotypes for up to similar to 80 000 individuals, allowing for 100% matching accuracy.
   Conclusions. Ultra-small SNP panels could provide an efficient method to approach the large-scale task of the traceability of beef products through the beef supply chain.

AB Most of the advances made in olive traceability are focusing on the arrival of the fruit to industry but it is necessary to manage all the operations involved in the production chain. This work introduces a new machineto-machine system that allows integrating all the information generated from the field to the market through a methodology for the real-time management of all operations carried out. The consumer can check the product history, farmers can consult and optimise their resources, and industry can control the operations performed. The system developed is composed of an electronic device, iOlivetrack-D, mounted on agricultural machinery which identify plots and sends the information generated to a web application, iOlivetrack-W. The system was tested in real working conditions obtaining good results in the identification of plots using RFID and GPS although the limitation about this technology must be considered for a commercial purpose. The registration of information associated in the web application has been carried successfully by an adaptable system that allow the access to the data in configurable ways. To complete the product chain information, industrial processing operations were simulated by entering the data manually through the application. Finally, a QR code was generated to provide consumer access to product traceability information that may be consulted in this paper. The work shows the pros and cons of this system which allows assured traceability of the entire production chain and the proper manage of the production.

AB Fresh pork is a meat that many people choose to eat in daily lives, and it is becoming more important to devise a method for ensuring the quality and safety of fresh pork. Combined with the meat quality of the cold chain and the environmental information collection program, this study presents a QR code based tracing method for a quality tracing system. This method includes a correction recognition test for the final design of the QR code. The results show that QR code can store large amounts of traceability information, with strong error correction capability, and can provide a great advantage in scanning recognition. In the process of consumption, consumers can easily obtain fresh pork quality information by scanning the QR code with a mobile phone, rather than having to choose a piece of meat to purchase based only on a visual observation of the meat.
   Practical applicationsIn this study, the design of the temperature acquisition scheme was verified in SMEs (small and medium enterprises), the results show that the data transmission is stable. The generated QR codes were tested in some supermarkets, have strong error correction capability, and can meet the retroactive requirements. According to this research, when the damage to the traceability barcode is beyond the range of 30% before the barcode enters circulation, the barcode needs to be reprinted.

The one-way ANOVA and Duncan multiple comparison results revealed Na, Sr, Ba, Cu, Mn, Fe, Al, Se, delta C-13 and delta N-15 varied significantly between the three regions (p < 0.05). A systematic clustering analysis revealed the stable isotopes combined with the mineral elements easily distinguished samples into the three different regions. Multivariate statistical analysis allowed us to establish a discriminant model for distinguishing P. clarkii from the three geographical regions. When stable isotopes were combined with mineral elements, the accuracy of the linear discriminant analysis of the samples from Guangdong, Hunan and Hubei were 95%, 95% and 100%, respectively. The initial overall discriminant accuracy was 96.7%, and the cross-validation discriminant accuracy was 93.3%. Principal component analysis identified three main components which were based on eleven major factors, including Cu, Ba, Cd, Mn, delta C-13, delta N-15, Al and Mg, resulting in a cumulative variance contribution rate of 78.77%. We established a three-dimensional coordinate system using the three principal components to create scatter diagrams with the samples from the three regions in the coordinate system. The results revealed the samples clearly differentiated into the three regions. Therefore, mineral elements combined with stable isotopes can distinguish the regional origin of P. clarkii.

AB Background: Edible oils play a vital role in our daily life, which provide human beings with energy, essential fatty acids and nutrients. The quality of edible oils can be dependent on the quality of the oilseeds they originate from, and their adulteration during processing. In recent years, near infrared spectroscopy was widely used in the rapid assessment of quality of oilseeds and edible oils. However, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive review on near infrared spectroscopy for the quality of oilseeds remains to be published.
   Scope and approach: The applications of near infrared spectroscopy in the quality of oilseeds and edible oils have been emphasized in this review. This article briefly summarizes the basic knowledge of near infrared spectroscopy. In addition, we highlight the application of this technique on the detection of physicochemical properties and quality, specific nutrient components, authentication, and geographical origin traceability of oilseeds and edible oils. Moreover, the application of near infrared hyperspectral imaging technology in oilseeds has been addressed.
   Key findings and conclusions: Near infrared spectroscopy possesses the advantages of rapid, green and low-cost analysis. Meanwhile, it is also a nondestructive method and therefore suitable to quality analysis of oilseeds in agricultural sciences. It can be used to detect macro nutrients in oilseeds and edible oils by combining NIR and advanced chemometrics. In the future, NIR could be applied in the rapid detection and online detection of hazardous substances and nutrients in oilseeds by developing the new instrument and chemometric methods.

AB Mushrooms became one of the most popular food resources worldwide that are very appreciated by consumers. Fresh produce properties including mushrooms are obviously varied based on their geographical origins. In view of the significant increase in the world's production of mushrooms, this will be accompanied by the increasing attention of all actors in the international food trade system (producers, traders, consumers and the authorities) to obtain a safe and high-quality commodity. This can be achieved through the implementation of an efficient and universal geo-tracing technique. Current approaches of geo-tracing mushrooms are few and have several limitations. Our intent is to suggest the DNA barcoding as a potent and universal method for mushrooms geo-traceability.

AB Insects are amongst the greatest pests of agriculture, horticulture and forestry worldwide, inflicting damage and economic costs both directly and by transmitting plant viruses. Many kinds of insects are now resistant or cross-resistant to pesticides. Tracking studies have become very important for combatting insect pests and for better understanding their biology (eg insect population dynamics, movements, feeding behaviour and other ecological interactions). A wide variety of tracing approaches have been used including discriminative, tracer and molecular methods. The perfect technique for insect tracking is the technique that harmonizes with insects' 'normal' biology. Furthermore, the technique should be environmentally safe, cost-effective and easy to use. This paper reviews the current techniques used for insect traceability, documents the advantages and drawbacks of each method, and puts special focus on molecular techniques, including PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis as a new and promising traceability tool that could provide insects with a unique biological barcode and thus make it possible to trace their movements.

AB Risks associated with mycotoxin contamination of cereals, that are included in the ten major staple foods and greatly contribute to the dietary energy intake, are of worldwide relevance. In small grain cereals, mycotoxins are produced by fungi such as Aspergillus, Penicillium, Alternaria and Fusarium that colonize the plant in the field and can grow during the post-harvest period, producing several classes of mycotoxins. The identification of mycotoxigenic fungal species and strains is essential for developing effective strategies for control. For this purpose, genetic traceability has proved to be a valuable tool that can be applied along the whole production chain, starting in the field for early diagnosis of FHB (Fusarium Head Blight) disease to the final processing steps, such as malting or pasta making. In this paper, DNA-based analytical tools that are currently available for the identification and quantification of mycotoxigenic fungal species and strains are reviewed, with particular emphasis on Fusarium, and their possible applications in mycotoxin control in small grain cereal chains are discussed.

AB Gentiana rigescensFranch. ex Hemsl. is an important medicinal plant in China and the over exploitation of wild resources has affected its quality and clinical efficacy. The accumulation of plant secondary metabolites is not only determined by their genetic characteristics but also influenced by environmental factors. At present, many studies on evaluating the environmental conditions of its planting area are still in the qualitative stage. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a systematic evaluation method to deeply analyze the impact of environmental factors on the quality of medicinal materials and quickly verify the geographical origin. In this study, the contents of five iridoids (loganic acid, swertiamarin, sweroside, gentiopicroside and 6'-O-beta-D-glucopyranosylgentiopicroside) ofG. rigescensfrom 45 different origins (including 441 individuals) of Yunnan Province in China were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Analytical procedures of one-way analysis of variance, correlation analysis, principal components analysis, and hierarchical cluster analysis were employed to interpret the correlation of iridoid content and environmental factors. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) combined with two multivariate analysis methods (partial least squares discriminant analysis; support vector machines, SVM) was used to discriminate four major producing areas (158 individuals). The combination of SVM with grid search algorithm achieved an accuracy of 100% in the test set. One-way analysis of variance showed that the contents of five iridoids in root tissues ofG. rigescensvaried significantly among different origins, which was also verified by the chemometrics analysis results of hierarchical cluster analysis. The results of correlation analysis indicated that the high value of altitude and precipitation were unfavorable for the accumulation of these five iridoids. A correlation between increase of temperature and iridoid accumulation was observed. This study provided a certain theoretical basis for the resource protection and development ofG. rigescensbased on the correlation analysis between the ecological environment factors and quality.

AB Mid-infrared (MIR) and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy combined with chemometrics were explored to classify Cabernet Sauvignon wines from different countries (Australia, Chile and China). Commercial wines (n = 540) were scanned in transmission mode using MIR and NIR, and their characteristic fingerprint bands were extracted at 1750-1000 cm(-1) and 4555-4353 cm(-1). Through the identification system of Tri-step infrared spectroscopy, the correlation between macroscopic chemical fingerprints and geographical regions was explored more deeply. Furthermore, Principal component analysis (PCA), soft independent modelling of class analogy (SIMCA) and discriminant analysis (DA) based on MIR and NIR spectra were used to visualize or discriminate differences between samples and to realize geographical origin traceability of Cabernet Sauvignon wines. Through "external test set (n = 157)" validation, SIMCA models correctly classified 97%, 97% and 92% of Australian, Chilean and Chinese Cabernet Sauvignon wines, while the DA models correctly classified 86%, 85% and 77%, respectively. Based on unique digital fingerprints of spectroscopy (FT-MIR and FT-NIR) associated with chemometrics, geographical origin traceability was achieved in a more comprehensive, effective and rapid manner. The developed database models based on IR fingerprint spectroscopy with chemometrics could provide scientific basis and reference for geographical origin traceability of Cabernet Sauvignon wines (Australia, Chile and China).

AB Sr-87/Sr-86 was determined on fresh red and white grapes, soils and rocks from three selected vineyards to verify the isotopic relationships between the fruit of the vine and geologic substrata of vineyards. Sr-87/Sr-86 were determined on sampled grapes of four different harvest years and different grape varieties, on bioavailable fraction of soils, on whole soils, and on bedrocks from the geo-pedological substratum of the vineyards. The vineyards chosen for the experimental works belong to an organic farming winery and thus cultivation procedures were strictly controlled.
   Grapes were sampled during the harvests of four different but consecutive years with Sr-87/Sr-86 that does not change reflecting the values of the soil bioavailable fraction. No variations among grapes from different vine cultivars were observed. A strict isotope relationship with soil bio-available fraction was observed. These findings demonstrate the reliability of Sr-87/Sr-86, even at a very small scale, for food products geographic origin assessment.

AB Recent legal requirements and market demands have motivated more food companies to implement traceability systems. Ensuring safe farming practices is the first step in food supply chain traceability, and reasonable pesticide use is a main feature of food safety and sustainable production. This study describes the design and development of a cloud-based platform for rational pesticide use to guarantee the source safety of traceable vegetables. The system includes a pesticide use control cloud platform (PUCC) and a pesticide user application (PUA), which interactively guide users through the steps of pesticide purchasing, pesticide application, harvest time, and pesticide evaluation. Models for evaluating and recommending potential pesticides were developed based on an open library of pesticide use rules. The PUCC, which includes the main functions of farmer registration, authentication of platform administrator, and information management for plant protection service agencies, was developed using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 and deployed on the Internet. The PUA provides interfaces for pesticide purchasing guideline, pesticide application, optimal harvest time, and feedback. As a case study, the system was used for about a year in 24 vegetable bases in Tianjin. The effectiveness of the system was evaluated by investigating 8 management center staff members and 41 farmers. Management agencies noted the positive effects of promoting reasonable pesticide use, facilitating information accessibility, and enhancing management. Advantages to farmers included reducing the risk of unreasonable pesticide usage, decreasing the risk of counterfeit pesticides, and improving vegetable quality and safety; disadvantages included increased costs and reduced efficiency. In addition, the system improved external and internal traceability to ensure crop quality and safety. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a technology which provides appealing opportunities to improve the management of information flow within the supply chain and security in the agri-food sector. Nowadays, food safety is considered a major requirement in several countries, in particular, the traceability of food products which is mandatory by law. Thus, technological implementation leading to traceability strengthening in the agri-food sector is crucial. The first aim of this review is to analyze the current developments in RFID technology in the agri-food sector, through an operative framework which organizes the literature and facilitate a quick content analysis identifying future research direction. RFID technology seems to be able to bring great opportunities to this sector; nevertheless, several constraints are slowing its adoption. This survey may provide readers with an exhaustive overview of opportunities and constraints for the wide adoption of RFID. The second aim of this review is to provide an updated analysis on the current developments of RFID technology for different product typologies within the agri-food industry, discussing at the same time its potential in technological and logistical development regarding different sectors of the production/distribution chain. As referenced here, RFID implementations in the agri-food sector are increasing at a fast rate, and technological advancement follows the applicability opportunities. However, real applications of RFID technologies are still limited because of various technical and economical obstacles which are also discussed.

AB Traceability of food is considered as an important tool for ensuring food quality and safety, in turn increasing consumers' trust. Verification of food authenticity is currently carried out by officials and producers, typically through the use of paper documents that may not ensure a proper level of integrity. Therefore, independent analytical methods and forgery-proof labels are required by the agri-food sector, driving the development of "omics" traceability technologies for the authentication of foods. Despite the growing interest in these technologies from a technical-scientific point of view, no research has been carried out on consumers' perceptions. Given these premises, this study aimed at understanding consumers' orientations towards "omics" technologies applied to organic vegetables and unravelling the main psychological and socio-demographic variables that influence their adoption. Data were collected with a self-report questionnaire filled out by a sample of 807 Italians, representative of the population. We used descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression to analyze data. Results show that, despite the lack of subjective knowledge of "omics" technologies, Italians have positive attitudes and are interested in using and buying organic vegetables certified by this approach, even paying more. Furthermore, young people with positive attitudes and higher environmental concerns have a more positive attitude towards "omics" technologies. This research points out the need to educate consumers about what the "omics" technology is, enhancing consumers' attitudes and underlining its environmental contribution. This will increase consumers' acceptance and support the implementation of the technology.

AB Methods for individual identification are usually employed for traceability, whereas breed identification is useful to detect commercial frauds. In this study, Chinese Yellow Cattle (CYC) samples plus data from six Bos taurus breeds, two Bos indicus breeds, and one composite breed were used to develop an allocation test based on 22 microsatellites. The test allowed discriminating all foreign breeds from the CYC, although some CYC individuals were wrongly allocated as Limousin or Holstein, probably due to the recent introduction of these breeds into China. In addition, CYC evidenced a previously reported Zebu dine (south-north) and a possible structure within the B. taurus component that should be confirmed. An independent test performed with meat samples of unknown breed origin from Argentina allocated 92% of them to either Angus, Hereford, or their crossbreed, but none was identified as CYC. We conclude that the test is a suitable tool to certify meat of foreign breed origin and to detect adulterations of CYC beef labeled as imported meat. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Identification of individual pigs is essential for management, traceability, breeding, trading and disease control in commercial pig production. Conventional identification methods used for pigs, such as ear tags and tattoos, are not sufficiently reliable due to losses and code erasing. This study investigated the retention rate, functionality and tissue damage of microchips compared with conventional electronic ear tags and assessed the effects of chip size and pig age at microchip injection. A larger proportion of small (95.2%) than large (82.5%) microchips were readable throughout the rearing period (p < 0.031). It was better to inject microchips when the piglets were 9-10 weeks old compared with 1-2 weeks (p = 0.058). Ear tags caused significantly more tissue damage than microchips (p=0.001). However, although microchips met the requirements of an identification system for pigs that is unique, easy to read, does not produce apparent disturbance to the animals and causes minimal pathological changes, the proportion of lost microchips was unacceptably high. Further research on chip type, pig age at marking and marking site is needed to find suitable methods for identification of individual pigs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Amid high-profile food scares, health concerns and threats of information imperfection and asymmetry, the Chinese pork industry faces increasing demands from consumers for assurances regarding quality and production methods in both the domestic and export markets. Using a real choice experiment (RCE), 316 consumers in Wuxi, located in China's Jiangsu Province, were randomly surveyed to examine the impact of various factors (e.g., traceability, lean meat essence testing, animal welfare, appearance, and price) on consumers' preference and willingness to pay (WTP) for pork products. A random parameter logit model was estimated, and the results show that having a traceable code is the second important factor after price for consumers, corresponding to a WTP of 4.76 yuan per catty, followed by a bright red appearance, a national stocking density standard of animal welfare, and detected no lean meat essence, corresponding to a WTP of more than 2 yuan per catty. In addition, there is a complementary interrelationship between a traceable code and a bright red appearance, detected no lean meat essence, and a national stocking density standard of animal welfare. The results concerning the latent class model (LCM) indicate that 56.9% of consumers are "quality-focused" consumers who are willing to pay a high price for traceable code, detected no lean meat essence, a national stocking density standard of animal welfare, and bright red appearance attributes. A further 28.1% are "price-sensitive" consumers who pay significant attention to the price, and the price that they pay for each product is meagre. The consumers with "preference combination attributes" attach greater value to interaction attributes, such as a traceable code combined with detected no lean meat essence or a bright red appearance and detected no lean meat essence combined with a national stocking density standard of animal welfare or a bright red appearance, accounting for 15% of consumers. The government should improve the traceability system, increase the intensity of lean meat essence testing, promote the welfare level of pigs, and promote public education and publicity on pork quality and safety attributes. Meanwhile, enterprises can formulate "differentiated" pork products, according to different consumer groups, and appropriately increase prices, according to production costs, in order to meet the requirements for pork quality and safety for consumers.

AB In this study, a discriminant model was established by determining mineral element contents in tea leaves and the soil, collected from Lishui, Jiangsu Province, China. The contents of 12 elements (Se, Zn, Ni, Mn, Cr, Pb, Mg, Ca, Cu, Al, Na, and K) were determined in both tea leaves and soil samples. Cluster analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) were employed for regional classification of tea samples. After data conversion and correlation analysis, spatial and quantitative prediction models were established by ordinary Kriging interpolation and multiple linear regressions. The results indicated a corresponding relationship of elements between tea and soil, and the cluster analysis and PCA showed a clear distinction between tea from the north to that from the middle and south of Lishui. Kriging interpolation predicted the levels of 12 elements, and among them, Se, Ca, and Cr showed a related spatial distribution. Three linear regression equations were established using Mn, Al, Ni, and K contents and soil pH, and these equations fitted well between predicted and actual values. The established linear equations can be used to identify the predominant mineral elements in tea plants and soil from Lishui and to identify the geographical origin of the tea product.

AB Food safety is related to the national economy and people's livelihood and has always been the focus of the people and the government. Blockchain technology has characteristics of being decentralized, tamper-free, and having underlying openness. It can record and trace product information, prevent data tampering, effectively enhance the transparency of product information, and provide new methods and ideas for food safety traceability. At present, research hotspots mainly focus on the design and construction of a trusted blockchain traceability system, but the provided blockchain traceability system cannot provide a way to verify the authenticity of the information. This paper studies the credibility evaluation model of the members involved in the blockchain and the on-chain data quality model and provides a method to solve the credibility of the on-chain data. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of the method is validated by a case study.

AB Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) in agriculture have evolved from simple farm record-keeping into sophisticated and complex systems to support production management. The purpose of current FMIS is to meet the increased demands to reduce production costs, comply with agricultural standards, and maintain high product quality and safety. This paper presents current advancements in the functionality of academic and commercial FMIS. The study focuses on open-field crop production and centeres on farm managers as the primary users and decision makers. Core system architectures and application domains, adoption and profitability, and FMIS solutions for precision agriculture as the most information-intensive application area were analyzed. Our review of commercial solutions involved the analysis of 141 international software packages, categorized into 11 functions. Cluster analysis was used to group current commercial FMIS as well as examine possible avenues for further development. Academic FMIS involved more sophisticated systems covering compliance to standards applications, automated data capture as well as interoperability between different software packages. Conversely, commercial FMIS applications targeted everyday farm office tasks related to budgeting and finance, such as recordkeeping, machinery management, and documentation, with emerging trends showing new functions related to traceability, quality assurance and sales.

AB In this study, 110 consumers in Wuxi, China's Jiangsu Province were surveyed for their preferences for traceable pork in a real choice experiment. Using random parameters logit and latent class logit models, results revealed that consumers had the highest willingness to pay (WTP) for government certification of traceability information authenticity. Consumers also had higher WTP for origin labeling compared to uncertified traceability information. Moreover, traceability to slaughter and processing was viewed as a substitute for local farming labeling and complement to non-local farming labeling. Despite the heterogeneity among consumer groups, all consumers had some positive WTP for the local farming labeling attribute of traceable pork. Therefore, it is beneficial to include origin labeling in the traceable food attribute systems during the initial construction of traceable food markets in China.

AB The study aims to investigate the characterization of stable isotopic ratios in wheat milling fractions (bran, wheat shorts, and flour) and extracts (defatted flour, gluten, lipid, starch, and crude fiber) and correlations among different matrices for each isotope, which could provide some references for the development and application of stable isotopes for geographical traceability of wheat and its milling products. Wheat samples with three genotypes were collected from three regions in China. delta C-13 and delta N-15 values in wholemeal, milling fractions and extracts were determined. Results showed that delta C-13 varied significantly among milling fractions and extracts, while no significant difference was found among delta N-15 values of different milling fractions or extracts. Each isotope shows significantly positive correlations among wheat fractions (p < 0.01). The variations of delta C-13 and delta N-15 were most contributed by fraction and region, respectively. Therefore, delta N-15 is suitable for geographical traceability of wheat and its milling products.

AB Some events in recent years have weakened consumers' trust regarding food safety in a number of countries, including bird flu, hormones and residue of veterinary medicine in meat and, more recently, Operation Weak Flesh. COVID-19 also led to a focus on the urgent need to seek strict production standards that ensure food safety. In this scenario of uncertainty, traceability and certification could be useful tools to improve the perception of trust and safety in production processes. Thus, the aim of this study is to analyze the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the purchase intention of certified beef. A quantitative study was conducted with 862 Brazilian consumers. The data were treated using structural equation modeling. The results show that the level of subjective knowledge of certification is related to the importance attributed to traceability and purchase intention. The concern towards legality of slaughterhouses and to traceability was shown to be related to purchase intention. Furthermore, the higher the level of concern over COVID-19, the more important the influence of traceability becomes with regard to meat purchase intention.

AB Jinxiang garlic is a well-known commodity with protected geographical indication (PGI) status in China and is also registered PGI in the European Union. A stable isotope profile (C-13, N-15, H-2, O-18, and S-34) was used to construct a discrimination model to differentiate PGI Jinxiang garlic from other major garlic export countries (Argentina and Southeast Asian countries; Thailand and Vietnam), as well as garlic produced in other Chinese provinces (Guizhou and Hainan). Results showed that there were no significant isotope differences for Jinxiang garlic sampled from 13 towns across the county, especially for delta N-15 and delta H-2. delta O-18 value was not a suitable classification variable for origin, but delta H-2, delta N-15, and delta S-34 values were found to be useful to characterize garlic origin. Chemometrics showed pair-wise partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model was an appropriate method to distinguish Jinxiang garlic from other locations, with a total discriminant accuracy of more than 89.5 % and 100% classification of PGI Jinxiang garlic. This study has potential to provide a suitable traceability method to authenticate Jinxiang garlic with PGI status in international markets.

AB Olive oil traceability based on the intrinsic chemical composition of the oil is becoming increasingly important due to the prevalence of fraudulent geographical labelling of olive oils. For a traceability tool to be valid, it should be based on olive oil properties that are clearly related to provenance factors. However, multielement analysis of the oil has been used as a traceability tool without any proof of a direct link between the multielemental composition and the geographical origin of the oil. In order to verify this link, Tunisian olive terroir components from the 11 major olive-producing regions were sampled to evaluate the influences of these components (especially soil and climate) on the geochemical composition of Tunisian olive oil. Overall, geochemical processes relating to strontium and rare-earth element (REE) enrichment were found to control the multelemental compositions of Tunisian soils. Even though olive oils from the 11 Tunisian olive-growing regions considered did not strongly reflect the geochemical signatures of the corresponding Tunisian soils, the concentrations of four elements in the oils, namely Fe, Ti, Ni and Ba, showed significant positive Spearman correlations with their concentrations in the bioavailable extracts from those soils. Moreover, there were numerous significant correlations of elements in the olive oil with soil chemical and climate parameters. Our results clearly confirm that the complex interactions of the olives with the climate and soil chemistry during cultivation significantly affect the multielemental composition of the resulting olive oil. This finding implies that the elemental profile of the olive oil is an effective and valid marker of the geographical origin of the oil, as it is significantly linked to oil provenance factors. It also explains the discrepancies between the geochemical signature of an oil and that of the soil in which the olives were grown, as climate parameters affect the transfer of that signature from soil to olives. This work therefore provides the basis for a scientifically based approach to olive oil traceability. The results of this work can be utilized by agricultural authorities to realise the multielement-based traceability of olive oils from various Tunisian regions.

AB Cattle, buffalo and cow, identification has recently played an influential role towards understanding disease trajectory, vaccination and production management, animal traceability, and animal ownership assignment. Cattle identification and tracking refers to the process of accurately recognizing individual cattle and their products via a unique identifier or marker. Classical cattle identification and tracking methods such as ear tags, branding, tattooing, and electrical methods have long been in use; however, their performance is limited due to their vulnerability to losses, duplications, fraud, and security challenges. Owing to their uniqueness, immutability, and low costs, biometric traits mapped into animal identification systems have emerged as a promising trend. Biometric identifiers for beef animals include muzzle print images, iris patterns, and retinal vascular patterns. Although using biometric identifiers has replaced human experts with computerized systems, it raises additional challenges in terms of identifier capturing, identification accuracy, processing time, and overall system operability. This article reviews the evolution in cattle identification and tracking from classical methods to animal biometrics. It reports on traditional animal identification methods and their advantages and problems. Moreover, this article describes the deployment of biometric identifiers for effectively identifying beef animals. The article presents recent research findings in animal biometrics, with a strong focus on cattle biometric identifiers such as muzzle prints, iris patterns, and retinal vascular patterns. A discussion of current challenges involved in the biometric-based identification systems appears in the conclusions, which may drive future research directions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Cows with specialised characteristics and requirements can be aggregated into different herds for targeted nutritional management and to facilitate on-farm segregation of raw milk for the production of high-value niche dairy products, offering improved economic returns. Rapid methods for independent verification of product quality and origin are desirable to support validation and traceability of such products. This study examined the use of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to segregate raw milk from individual cows of multiple breeds from different herds fed on the same or differing feeding regimes, and to correlate and evaluate the efficacy of the predictions for crude protein and the milk fatty acid (FA) phenotypes for each of the herds. Reference values and near infrared spectra were obtained from representative freeze-dried raw milk samples (n = 220) collected from 847 lactating cows of 3 breeds from the Lincoln University dairy farm in New Zealand. The feed sources (i.e. pasture or pasture with lucerne silage) significantly influenced the protein and the FA values, and these differences were reflected in NIRS analyses. The partial least square regression models for crude protein determination showed excellent results, whereas for the most dominant FA, they were not appreciable. Maximum separation was obtained between the herds on the same feeding regime (mean specificity = 95.2%) using the partial least square discriminant analysis, and its overall performance in differentiating the objects was better than that of the soft independent modelling of class analogy. The multiclass analyses conducted in this study offer improvements to current approaches for evaluating and validating raw milk for the manufacture of specific dairy products, and for enhancing product traceability.

AB Traceability of fruits is only documentary. In case of doubt or fraud, no standardized analysis makes it possible to trace back the origin of the fruit. The aim of this study is to apply PCR-DGGE method to analyze in a unique step all the yeasts present on the fruit to create the linkage between yeast communities and their geographical origins. PCR-DGGE is a method of yeast ecology which was used to characterize all the yeast flora of three species of Physalis fruit (Physalis ixocarpa Brot, Physalis pruinosa Physalis peruviana L) from Colombia, Egypt, Uganda, Madagascar. DGGE fingerprints analyzed by multivariate analysis permitted to distinguish different fruit origins by their yeast communities. PCR-DGGE method is then proposed as a new traceability tool which provides to the fruits in general and Physalis in particular with a unique bar code for each country by using 26S rDNA fingerprinting of yeasts.

AB A reliable, qualitative PCR-based detection method for the traceability and authentication of common and Tartary buckwheat was developed. Five InDel markers developed from chloroplast genome variation between the two species were applied for 96 buckwheat accessions and all accessions were easily differentiated as Tartary and common buckwheat using these markers. We also determined the sample detection limit by PCR and qPCR as 0.001 and 0.02 ng/mu l, respectively. InDel markers could detect the mixture of two species flour up to 10% contamination. InDel markers were also applied to processed foods such as noodles and tea, and we found that species-specific PCR bands could be used to identify buckwheat even after processing. Hence, these InDel markers are simple with higher specificity and sensitivity and are reliable for the authentication of buckwheat processed foods.

AB Insect movement in the landscape remains often poorly known and in some cases does not make it possible to understand the role of the different cultivated and wild habitats in the dynamics of useful and pest insects. Insects are among the greatest pests of agriculture, horticulture and forestry worldwide, inflicting damage and economic costs both directly and by transmitting plant viruses. There is a need for tracking the migrant insects in agroecosystems through space and time to establish their migation. Furthermore, tracing the origin of pest insects allows to design more rapid, efficient and environment-friendly control systems (less use of insecticides). Tracking insects can also help us better understanding their biology (e.g. insect population dynamics, geo-traceability, feeding behavior and other ecological interactions). However. tracking insects presents a considerable challenge as they are often small, cryptic and highly mobile organisms. The most common methods of analysis currently proposed (microsatellite markers, stable isotopes) do not allow for the moment to determine their geographical origin. The ecological niche occupied by the insects highly influences the bacterial communities associated with the insects. Hence understanding the diversity of bacterial communities could be an option to trace the orgins of the pest. This paper presents two new protocols used to extract bacterial DNA from the Cotton Bollworm. Helicoverpa armigera and the analysis of this DNA by PCR-DGGE. This promising method is proposed as a new traceability tool which provides insects with a unique biological barcode and makes it possible to trace back the insects to their original location.

AB Edible bird's nest (EBN) swiftlet existed naturally 48,000 years ago in caves as their natural dwellings. Nowadays, edible bird's nest has become a very important industry due to its high nutritional, medicinal and economic value. Additionally, edible bird's nest has a long quality guarantee period. Obviously, the nutritional components and medicinal functions vary depending on geographical origins. Recently, the global demand for edible bird's nest has markedly increased, accompanied by the increasing attention of all key players of the global food trade system, i.e., producers, consumers, traders and the authorities to obtain safe and high-quality edible bird's nest. Hence, this target can be accomplished via the enforcement of an efficient and universal geo-tracing technique. Current methods of the geo-tracking of edible bird's nest, i.e., automation, physical and analytical techniques have several limitations and all of them fail to discriminate different quality grades of edible bird's nest. Meanwhile, in many studies and applications, polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) has proven to be a "cutting edge" technique for greatly enhance food traceability from field to fork through its ability in distinguishing the food products in terms of their quality and safety. This article provides an overview of (1) edible bird's nest as a multiuse strategic food product, (2) quality issues associated with edible bird's nest including implications that the site of acquisition of the edible bird's nest has food safety implications, (3) current regulations and geo-tracking approaches to ensure the safety and quality of edible bird's nest with the special focus on polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis technique as a vigorous and universal geo-tracing tool to be suggested for edible bird's nest geo-traceability.

AB Illegal logging is a global problem associated with deforestation, climate change, and biodiversity loss with significant negative economic, environmental, and social impacts. In response to this phenomenon, European Union has enacted the European Timber Regulation (EUTR) that imposes economic operators to exercise due diligence thanks to traceability verifications. These are mainly based on a "paper-based" approach, with implementation issues as a consequence.Italy is a interesting case study, since it is the first importer of wood-energy biomass worldwide, where tons of fuelwood without clear traceability are imported every year, and EUTR enforcement still lags behind. Here, a Living Lab involving stakeholders and key informants, carried out a participatory and open assessment of the impact of digital technologies on EUTR enforcement and traceability in the national wood-energy sector.Results reveals that, even if digitalisation is at the first stage, it is far from being only a technological phenomenon since it is already able to impact on different aspects (social, economic, territorial, institutional) related to the EUTR application.Policymakers are therefore recommended to rely on holistic evaluations and approaches that recognise such a complexity, in order to foster a creation of a viable digital ecosystem in favour of EUTR implementation and traceability in the wood-energy sector.

AB Simple Summary
   European sea bass is one of the most economically important fish species in the Mediterranean area. The potential effects of farming systems on the final quality of this product and the recent popular demand for labels to certify the animal rearing origin, which is increasingly used as a marketing tool, have raised the use of analytical techniques that make it possible to differentiate this fish product according to the rearing farming system and authenticate their geographical origin. The aim of this study was to determine whether isotopic ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) can discriminate farmed European sea bass according to different farming systems (concrete tank inland, sea cages, and extensive methods in valleys or salt works) and geographic origins (different locations scattered throughout Italy). The results of this study showed the viability of delta C-13 and delta N-15 to discriminate cultured sea bass from different farming systems (extensive vs. intensive) reared at different geographical sites in Italy. Meanwhile, the measurement of delta O-18 and delta H-2 made it possible to distinguish the geographical origin of the sea bass farmed extensively and intensively (in cages).
   This study aimed to determine whether isotopic ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) can discriminate farmed European sea bass according to different farming systems and geographic origins. Dicentrarchus labrax of commercial size from three different rearing systems (concrete tank inland, sea cages, and extensive methods in valleys or salt works) were collected at the trading period (autumn-winter). For each farming type, different locations spread over Italy were monitored. Once the fish were harvested, the muscle and feed were sampled. For both muscle and feed, delta C-13 and delta N-15 were measured by continuous flow elemental analyzer isotope ratio mass spectrometry (CF-EA-IRMS) with the goal of discriminating samples based on the rearing system. Additional delta H-2 and delta O-18 measurements of fish samples were performed by continuous flow total combustion elemental analyzer isotope ratio mass spectrometry (CF-TC/EA-IRMS) to track the geographical origin. The measurements of delta C-13 and delta N-15 made it possible to discriminate cultured sea bass from different farming systems (extensive vs. intensive) reared at different geographical sites in Italy. Additional information was obtained from delta O-18 and delta H-2, which enabled the geographical areas of origin of the sea bass farmed extensively and intensively (in cages) to be distinguished.

AB Increased focus towards food safety and quality is reshaping food purchasing decisions around the world. Although some food attributes are visible, many of the attributes that consumers seek and are willing to pay a price premium for are not. Consequently, consumers rely on trusted cues and information to help them verify the food quality and credence attributes they seek. In this study, we synthesise the findings from previous research to generate a framework illustrating the key trust influencing factors that are beyond visual and brand-related cues. Our framework identifies that consumer trust in food and the food system is established through the assurances related to individual food products and the actors of the food system. Specifically, product assurance builds consumer trust through food packaging labels communicating food attribute claims, certifications, country or region of origin, and food traceability information. In addition, producers, processors, and retailers provide consumers with food safety and quality assurances, while government agencies, third-party institutions, advocacy groups, and the mass media may modify how labelling information and food operators are perceived by consumers. We hope our framework will guide future research efforts to test these trust factors in various consumer and market settings.</p>

AB Food safety is a global public health issue, which often arises from asymmetric information between consumers and suppliers. With the development of information technology in human life, building a food traceability information sharing platform is viewed as one of the best ways to overcome the trust crisis and resolve the problem of information asymmetry in China. However, among the myriad information available from the food supply chain, there is a lack of knowledge on consumer preference. Based on the best-worst scaling approach, this paper investigated consumer preferences for vegetable, pork, and dairy product traceability information. Specifically, this paper measured the relative importance that consumers place on the traceable information. The results indicate that consumers have varying priorities for information in different cases. "Pesticide/veterinary use," "picking/slaughtering date," and "fertilizer/feed use" are the most preferred traceable information for Chinese consumers in the case of vegetables, while "picking/slaughtering date" and "history of illness and taking protective measures" are the most preferred information in the case of pork. In the case of dairy products, consumers prefer "processing information," "environmental information of the origin," and "traceable tag certification information" most. The results of this study call for the direct involvement of the Chinese government in the food safety information sharing system as following. First, given consumers' diverse preferences, different types of traceable information should be recorded into the information sharing platform depending on food types. Second, the government could promote the step-by-step construction of such a platform based on the priority of consumers' preferences. Third, new technology should be applied to guarantee the reliability of traceable information. Finally, local preferences in terms of the way consumers receive and understand information should be taken into consideration.

AB BACKGROUND: The raspberry, Rubus idaeus L., provides several plant parts (as buds) used for food supplements. The aim of this researchwas to establish a technique for chemical composition control of R. idaeus herbal preparations, using chromatographic methods. These methods allowed us to identify and quantify the main phytochemicals, obtaining a specific phytochemical fingerprint (phytocomplex). Combinedwith two different chemometricmethods - clustering analysis and principal component analysis -the raspberry bud extracts of the different cultivars were efficiently characterized.
   RESULTS: Rubus idaeus buds were identified as a rich source of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds: organic acids, vitamins andcatechinswere foundto be themostdiscriminating variablesby chemometric techniques todifferentiate raspberry cultivars. In particular, catechins (13.25%) and flavonols (8.71%) were the most important polyphenolic classes, followed by cinnamic and benzoic acids.
   CONCLUSION: This study developed a useful tool for R. idaeus extract phytochemical characterization that could be applied also for differentiation and composition control of other herbal preparations. (C) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Barbera d'Asti-including Barbera d'Asti superiore-and Nizza are two DOCG (Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita) wines produced in Piemonte (Italy) from the Barbera grape variety. Differences among them arise in the production specifications in terms of purity, ageing, and zone of production, in particular with concern to Nizza, which follows the most stringent rules, sells at three times the average price, and is considered to have the highest market value. To guarantee producers and consumers, authentication methods must be developed in order to distinguish among the different wines. As the production zones totally overlap, it is important to verify whether the distinction is possible or not according to metals content, or whether chemical markers more linked to winemaking are needed. In this work, Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) elemental analysis and multivariate data analysis are used to study the authentication and traceability of samples from the three designations of 2015 vintage. The results show that, as far as elemental distribution in wine is concerned, work in the cellar, rather than geographic provenance, is crucial for the possibility of distinction.

AB It is difficult to trace grains to their original harvest because doing so requires unique and accurate grain labels, which are mixed when handled in massive quantities and derived from different origins. Food-grade grain tracers have been developed as an identification technology for tracing from original harvest to final destination. To implement online production operation for food-grade grain tracers by QR code scanning and information recording, automatic separation and identification equipment was designed in three parts: vibration screen separation, transmission and recognition assembly and host computer software for traceability. Improvements in the recognition rate, wear rate and screening rate of the equipment in the grain tracing system was achieved based on a Box Behnken design (BBD) using response surface methodology (RSM). Four factors that affect the working parameters (i.e., vibration frequency, screen angle, tracer density and conveyor speed) were selected, and their value ranges were confirmed. The following optimal working parameters were obtained: a vibration frequency of 40.13 Hz, a screen angle of 5.00 degrees, a tracer density of 5 tracers per 1.5 kg wheat and a conveyor speed of 0.15 m/s. Test results show that the automatic separation and identification equipment is practical for grain tracing systems. The experimental values of the recognition rate and screening rate under optimized conditions were similar to the predicted values, which confirmed the validity of the models. The advantage of this equipment is that it represents an online approach for separating and identifying tracers that would not require production interruptions or manual recognition. Therefore, this automatic separation and identification equipment holds a certain significance for the design and development of grain tracing systems, possibly providing a basis for the implementation and further research of other food traceability systems.

AB Paris polyphylla has been used by multiple nationalities as a traditional herb medicine to treat diseases in different regions of China. Since Paris quality is influenced by geographical regions, a fast and effective geographical traceability method is necessary. In our study, the geographical origin discrimination of 789 P. yunnanensis species from central, western, northwest, southeast and southwest Yunnan with 3rd to 8th cultivation years was carried out by chemometric of partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), random forest (RF) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) combined with attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform mid infrared (ATR-FTMIR). The results indicated that principal component analysis (PCA) was successfully used as an exploration data analysis method to remove outliers. Additionally, classification ability of PLS-DA model, established by variable importance for the projection (VIP), was similar to that of PLS-DA model, which indicated that raw ATR-FTMIR spectra contained abundant redundant information useless for classifying samples. For each model, the range of VIP values of PLS-DA is wider than the range of the important variables of RF, and PLS-DA was more time-efficient and high-ability than RF model. Besides, the geographical origin PLS-DA classification model with all collected samples was used to verify the results with accuracy rates of calibration set and validation set of 98.34% and 93.78%, respectively. HCA verified that the impact of geographical origin on P. yunnanensis characteristics is greater than that of the number of cultivation years. In short, PLS-DA model can assure the accuracy and limit time for identification analysis of cultivated P. yunnanensis quality assessment from different geographical origins.

AB The potential of traceability by nutrients and mineral elements in highland barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) from five cities in Tibet were investigated. The results showed that there were significant differences in nutrients and mineral elements in highland barley from different regions (P < 0.05). The original classification accuracy of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was 78.3%, and the discrimination accuracy of training set samples based on partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model was over 65%. The results of correlation analysis show that five elements (Fe, Zn, K, Mn and P) in highland barley are related to the concentration of elements in soil, while three elements (Ca, Cu and Mg) in highland barley have no obvious correlation with soil, because the special natural environment in Tibet affecting the growth of highland barley. This indicates that the origin traceability of highland barley can be achieved by measuring its nutrients and mineral elements.

AB The knowledge of a chemistry relationship between the soil and the agricultural products is an important tool for the quality assessment of food. We studied YLOID (Y, La and lanthanoids), recognized as very useful tracers due their coherent and predictable behavior, to trace and evaluate their distribution from soil to the grape in Vitis vinifera L. Because much of the world's viticulture is based on grafting, and rootstocks have proved affect vine growth, yield, fruit and wine quality, we carried out experimental trials to analyse the YLOID distribution of two different red cultivars, grafted onto six different rootstocks, on the same soil. The YLOID amounts, the relationship Heavy vs Light YLOID and the pattern of YLOID were calculated. The results showed that the different grafting combinations were not able to induce significant differences in YLOID uptake from the soil maintaining the same fingerprint (with the exception of Eu).

AB The aims of this investigation were to analyse the genetic variation of two Piemonte chicken local breeds, Bionda Piemontese and Bianca di Saluzzo, and to set them against some commercial lines. A panel of 19 microsatellite markers was used. On the overall, the results of different analyses highlight the genetic uniqueness of the two breeds; therefore they should be considered genetic resources worthy of preservation. The panel of microsatellites used in this investigation turns out to be a consistent and reliable tool for traceability. In fact, these markers are able to distinguish the two local populations from the commercial lines and they are able to confirm the existence of two genetically different clusters within the Bionda Piemontese, namely the ecotypes standard and Cuneo. Mating policies implemented to avoid inbreeding and, if necessary, a marker assisted conservation scheme would be sufficient to solve the problem of inbreeding.

AB The effects of origin, genotype, harvest year, and their interactions on wheat near infrared (NIR) spectra were studied to find the reasons for differences in NIR fingerprints of wheat from different geographical origins and the stability of NIR fingerprints among different years. Ten varieties were grown in three regions of China for 2 years. 180 kernel samples were analysed by NIR. The spectra after pre-treatment were analysed by principal component analysis, multi-way analysis of variance, and discriminant partial least-squares. The results showed that origin, genotype, year, and their interactions all had significant effects on wheat NIR fingerprints. The second overtones of N-H and C-H stretching vibrations and a combination of stretch and deformation of C-H group in wheat were mainly influenced by the geographical origin. The wavelength ranges 975-990 nm, 1200 nm, and 1355-1380 nm contained plenty of origin information to build robust discriminant models of wheat geographical origin. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is a high-quality product that has become one of the stars in the food fraud context in recent years. EVOO can encounter different types of fraud, from adulteration with cheaper oils to mislabeling, and for this reason, the assessment of its authenticity and traceability can be challenging. There are several officially recognized analytical methods for its authentication, but they are not able to unambiguously trace the geographical and botanical origin of EVOOs. The application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to EVOO is reviewed here as a reliable and rapid tool to verify different aspects of its adulteration, such as undeclared blends with cheaper oils and cultivar and geographical origin mislabeling. This technique makes it possible to use both targeted and untargeted approaches and to determine the olive oil metabolomic profile and the quantification of its constituents.

AB Paris polyphylla Smith var. yunnanensis (Franch.) Hand.-Mazz (PPY) was a frequently used herbal medicine in pharmaceutical field and different provenances might affect the clinical efficacy. Tracing the geographical origin was an important portion for PPY authentication and quality assessment. Present study was compared low-, mid and high-level data fusion methodology for geographical traceability of PPY samples (161 batches) combined with multivariate classification methods such as support vector machine gird search (SVM-GS) and random forest (RF) on the basis of Fourier transform mid-infrared (FT-MIR) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra. Compared with the low-and mid-level data fusion strategy results basing on SVM-GS algorithm, result of high-level data fusion method (calculated by RF) was more satisfying. Result of RF basing on high-level data fusion strategy showed that merely two samples were misclassified and one sample was multiple assigned after voting with fuzzy set theory. Values of specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy rates were exceeded 0.91, 0.99 and 90.91%, for each class respectively, satisfying results of these were shown in training and test sets for high-level data fusion method. This feasible result indicated that the RF algorithm could establish a reliable and good performance model in geographical traceability on the basis of high-level data fusion strategy. Combination of high-level data fusion and RF algorithm could consider as a good choice for establishing a discrimination multivariate model for origins identification of PPY samples.

AB Abusive business practices are increasingly evident in consumer packaged goods. Although consumers have the right to protect themselves against such practices, rapid urbanization and industrialization result in greater distances between producers and consumers, raising serious concerns on the supply chain. The operational complexities surrounding halal authentication pose serious challenges on the integrity of consumer packaged goods. This article attempts to address the progress and challenges associated with halal authentication. Advancement and concerns on the application of new, rapid analytical methods for halal authentication are discussed. The significance of zero tolerance policy in consumer packaged foods and its impact on analytical testing are presented. The role of halal assurance systems and their challenges are also considered. In conclusion, consensus on the establishment of one standard approach coupled with a sound traceability system and constant monitoring would certainly improve and ensure halalness of consumer packaged goods.

AB Olive oil is considered a premium product for its nutritional value and health benefits, and the ability to define its origin and varietal composition is a key step towards ensuring the traceability of the product. However, isolating the DNA from such a matrix is a difficult task. In this study, the quality and quantity of olive oil DNA, isolated using four different DNA isolation protocols, was evaluated using the qRT-PCR and ddPCR techniques. The results indicate that CTAB-based extraction methods were the best for unfiltered oil, while Nucleo Spin-based extraction protocols showed greater overall reproducibility. The use of both qRT-PCR and ddPCR led to the absolute quantification of the DNA copy number. The results clearly demonstrate the importance of the choice of DNA-isolation protocol, which should take into consideration the qualitative aspects of DNA and the evaluation of the amplified DNA copy number.

AB Several market research studies have shown that consumers are primarily concerned with the provenance of the food they eat. Among the available identification methods, only DNA-based techniques appear able to completely prevent frauds. In this study, a new method to discriminate among different bovine breeds and assign new individuals to groups was developed. Bulls of three cattle breeds farmed in Italy - Holstein, Brown, and Simmental - were genotyped using the 50K SNP Illumina BeadChip. Multivariate canonical discriminant analysis was used to discriminate among breeds, and discriminant analysis (DA) was used to assign new observations. This method was able to completely identify the three groups at chromosome level. Moreover, a genome-wide analysis developed using 340 linearly independent SNPs yielded a significant separation among groups. Using the reduced set of markers, the DA was able to assign 30 independent individuals to the proper breed. Finally, a set of 48 high discriminant SNPs was selected and used to develop a new run of the analysis. Again, the procedure was able to significantly identify the three breeds and to correctly assign new observations. These results suggest that an assay with the selected 48 SNP could be used to routinely track monobreed products.

While food traceability systems (FTSs) inform supply chain actors of product and logistical attributes, large scale implementations are scarce and are do not support active decision making. We present a framework developed for FUTUREMED project used to perform a data-driven analysis that considers both micro and macro aspects of a food supply chain (FSC). With its comprehensive multiple-depth data architecture incorporated within a tailored decision-support platform, this framework and the resulting decision-support tool is the first to move beyond simple traceability implementation to the sustainable planning of food logistics, bridging the gap between research techniques and real-world data availability. We define KPIs that measure a subset of economic and environmental factors to quantify the impact of logistical decisions. We validate the framework with the case study of an Italian fruit trader that is considering opening a new warehouse. We conclude by suggesting that this framework be applied to more complex case studies and be enhanced through including more dimensions of sustainability. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A targeted approach using HS-SPME-GC-MS was performed to compare flavour compounds of 'Navelina' and 'Salustiana' orange cultivars from organic and conventional management systems. Both varieties of conventional oranges showed higher content of ester compounds. On the other hand, higher content of some compounds related with the geranyl-diphosphate pathway (neryl and geranyl acetates) and some terpenoids were found in the organic samples. Furthermore, the partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) achieved an effective classification for oranges based on the farming system using their volatile profiles (90 and 100% correct classification). To our knowledge, it is the first time that a comparative study dealing with farming systems and orange aroma profile has been performed. These new insights, taking into account local databases, cultivars and advanced analytical tools, highlight the potential of volatile composition for organic orange discrimination.

AB Three data fusion strategies (low-llevel, mid-llevel, and high-llevel) combined with a multivariate classification algorithm (random forest, RF) were applied to authenticate the geographical origins of Panax notoginseng collected from five regions of Yunnan province in China. In low-level fusion, the original data from two spectra (Fourier transform mid-IR spectrum and near-IR spectrum) were directly concatenated into a new matrix, which then was applied for the classification. Mid-level fusion was the strategy that inputted variables extracted from the spectral data into an RF classification model. The extracted variables were processed by iterate variable selection of the RF model and principal component analysis. The use of high-level fusion combined the decision making of each spectroscopic technique and resulted in an ensemble decision. The results showed that the mid-level and high-level data fusion take advantage of the information synergy from two spectroscopic techniques and had better classification performance than that of independent decision making. High-level data fusion is the most effective strategy since the classification results are better than those of the other fusion strategies: accuracy rates ranged between 93% and 96% for the low-level data fusion, between 95% and 98% for the mid-level data fusion, and between 98% and 100% for the high-level data fusion. In conclusion, the high-level data fusion strategy for Fourier transform mid-IR and near-IR spectra can be used as a reliable tool for correct geographical identification of P. notoginseng.

AB H-1 High Resolution Magic Angle Spinning-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (HRMAS-NMR) spectroscopy was used to analyse garlic (Allium sativum L) belonging to red and white varieties and collected in different Italian regions, in order to address the traceability issue. 1D and 2D NMR spectra, performed directly on untreated small pieces of garlic, so without any sample manipulation, allowed the assignment of several compounds: organic acids, sugars, fatty acids, amino acids and the nutritionally important fructo-oligosaccharides and allyl-organosulphur compounds.
   Application of Partial Least Squares projections to latent structures-Discrimination Analysis provided an excellent model for the discrimination of both the variety and, most important, the place origin, allowing the identification of the metabolites contributing to such classifications.
   The presence of organosulphurs, allicin and some allyl-organosulphurs found by HRMAS-NMR, was confirmed also by SPME-GC-MS; 11 molecules were identified, containing from one up to three sulphur atoms and with and without allyl moieties. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The request for an efficient traceability system able to identify hazelnut cultivars along the entire processing chain is becoming a critical point for avoiding fraudulent practices and safeguarding the interests of growers, food processors and consumers. In this study, DNA was extracted from different hazelnut matrices, including plant material (leaf, kernel and kernel episperm), and processed foods (paste, grain, flour and different types of snacks containing hazelnuts). The efficiency of Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers was tested to identify the hazelnut cultivar 'Tonda Gentile' in all the supply chain. The analysis at 10 SSR loci was able to verify the presence/absence of the alleles of a declared cultivar contained in these matrices. The SSR analysis of DNA from raw episperm offers the possibility of identifying the mother cultivar and is suggested as an effective way to discover frauds since DNA analysis can be performed on individual kernels. For food matrices containing hazelnuts, the presence of the mother cultivar's DNA can be assessed based on the identification of its alleles in the sample, although the presence of multiple alleles from the pollenizers makes the interpretation of results more difficult.

AB Multi-element analysis including stable isotopes can be used as a possible indicator for food safety and security. For the certification of geographical origin, the analytical methods can be performed in two ways: one where multivariate analysis is used to determine the concentrations of such omnipresent elements as Al, Ca, Cl, Mg, Mn, Fe and Zn, and one that focuses on such special elements as the stable isotope ratios of Sr, O, and H. For the certification of production methods, especially those regarding organic products, delta N-15 values could be a potential indicator, particularly in such protected cultivations as in a plant factory (advanced-type greenhouse horticulture). Because the accuracy of these values is affected by production conditions, the delta N-15 values of products can be predicted more accurately under controlled conditions, such as in a plant factory using delta N-15-evaluated fertilizer, medium, and water. Non-destructive systems have been developed for measuring both the level of elements in a product and the production environment, such as soil conditions. In the near future, the results of chemically analyzed and those of non-destructively analyzed elemental composition will become interconnected to non-destructively certify the geographical origin and production method of agricultural products. All these destructive methods have been used to a limited extent for practical regulation as an analysis guideline; however, a combined system involving the use of the newly developed detector (non-destructive), data collection, and analysis using artificial intelligence could address the issue of falsely labeled products for practical application. Particularly in a plant factory, production is controlled and regulated, allowing the tracing of products from the farm to the table. In this context, the greenhouse production system would be an advanced example for the practical use of food safety combined with analytical chemistry and information communication technology.

AB A highly sensitive TaqMan real-time PCR assay targeting the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene was developed for detection of an avian-specific DNA fragment (68 bp) in farm animal and pet feeds. The specificity of the assay was verified against a wide representation of animal and plant species. Applicability assessment of the avian real-time PCR was conducted through representative analysis of two types of compound feeds: industrial farm animal feeds (n = 60) subjected to extreme temperatures, and commercial dog and cat feeds (n = 210). Results obtained demonstrated the suitability of the real-time PCR assay to detect the presence of low percentages of highly processed avian material in the feed samples analysed. Although quantification results were well reproducible under the experimental conditions tested, an accurate estimation of the target content in feeds is impossible in practice. Nevertheless, the method may be useful as an alternative tool for traceability purposes within the framework of feed control. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this study was the designing of a fast and reliable multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) identification system for testing the pure and mixed species origin of meat samples. For conducting this research, different primers were designed for each species according to the conserved region of mitochondrial cytochrome b (Cytb) gene. The results revealed different specific amplified fragments of pure meat sources for buffalo, goat, cattle and sheep species. After mixing different portions of the mentioned meat sources, this method was able to trace less than 10% of the other species of meat in the mixture. Then, it can be concluded that this procedure is simple, cheap, rapid, and efficient, and so it can be used in the meat industry.

AB In the context of products from certain regions or countries being banned because of an identified or non-identified hazard, proof of geographical origin is essential with regard to feed and food safety issues. Usually, the product labeling of an affected feed lot shows origin, and the paper documentation shows traceability. Incorrect product labeling is common in embargo situations, however, and alternative analytical strategies for controlling feed authenticity are therefore needed. In this study, distillers' dried grains and solubles (DDGS) were chosen as the product on which to base a comparison of analytical strategies aimed at identifying the most appropriate one. Various analytical techniques were investigated for their ability to authenticate DDGS, including spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques combined with multivariate data analysis, as well as proven techniques for authenticating food, such as DNA analysis and stable isotope ratio analysis. An external validation procedure (called the system challenge) was used to analyze sample sets blind and to compare analytical techniques. All the techniques were adapted so as to be applicable to the DDGS matrix. They produced positive results in determining the botanical origin of DDGS (corn vs. wheat), and several of them were able to determine the geographical origin of the DDGS in the sample set. The maintenance and extension of the databanks generated in this study through the analysis of new authentic samples from a single location are essential in order to monitor developments and processing that could affect authentication.

AB A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the suitability of stable isotope analysis for inferring the feeding histories of cattle fed known feeds. Stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen (delta C-13 and delta N-15) were measured in meat and hair from cattle and in their feeds at five farms in different regions of Japan, and the correlations of the isotope ratios between meat and hair were analysed. The results showed that delta C-13 values in feed depend on the photosynthesis type: C-3 or C-4. The values of delta N-15 in feeds varied widely, indicating divergent feeds made from plant materials that have different nitrogen origins, such as soil, chemical fertilizer, manure and air. In both cattle meat and hair, the farms differed significantly in the values of delta C-13 and delta N-15. Both delta C-13 and delta N-15 were significantly higher in hair than in meat, and high correlations between meat and hair in both delta C-13 and delta N-15 were found. The results suggested that stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis for cattle meat and hair could be used to trace the feeding histories of cattle in Japan, and that hair samples would be used as an alternative to meat.

AB The aim of this work is to identify and discuss physicochemical wine characteristics, to provide to some extent a link to the vintage, variety, and/or geographical origin. Bibliographic datasets were attempted to provide the main information for topic comprehension, identifying the sources of wine compositional variability and how these can be expressed in terms of the belonging categories. Since all the environmental and technological conditions which vineyard and wine are subjected are rarely known, different sources were inspected. Great importance was given to the study of isotopic composition because of its importance in food frauds detection history. The interaction of the plant genotype with the environmental conditions of the vintage is the main responsible for the wines organic and inorganic fraction variability in terms of both total and relative content. This phenotypical expression, together with human and abiotic variability sources, has been examined since it contains to some extent the information for the discrimination of wines according to their category. Recently, new proton nuclear magnetic resonance CH NMR) spectroscopy techniques have been under study and, used concurrently to chemometric data management procedures, showed to be an interesting and promising tool for wine characterization according to both vintage and variety.

AB Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) is the main leafy vegetable produced in Brazil. Since its production is widespread all over the country, lettuce traceability and quality assurance is hampered. In this study, we propose a new method to identify the geographical origin of Brazilian lettuce. The method uses a powerful data mining technique called support vector machines (SVM) applied to elemental composition and soil properties of samples analyzed. We investigated lettuce produced in Sao Paulo and Pernambuco, two states in the southeastern and northeastern regions in Brazil, respectively. We investigated efficiency of the SVM model by comparing its results with those achieved by traditional linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The SVM models outperformed the LDA models in the two scenarios investigated, achieving an average of 98 % prediction accuracy to discriminate lettuce from both states. A feature evaluation formula, called F-score, was used to measure the discriminative power of the variables analyzed. The soil exchangeable cation capacity, soil contents of low crystalized Al and Zn content in lettuce samples were the most relevant components for differentiation. Our results reinforce the potential of data mining and machine learning techniques to support traceability strategies and authentication of leafy vegetables.

AB Preserving diversity of indigenous pig (Sus scrofa) breeds is a key factor to (i) sustain the pork chain (both at local and global scales) including the production of high-quality branded products, (ii) enrich the animal biobanking and (iii) progress conservation policies. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips offer the opportunity for whole-genome comparisons among individuals and breeds. Animals from twenty European local pigs breeds, reared in nine countries (Croatia: Black Slavonian, Turopolje; France: Basque, Gascon; Germany: Schwabisch-Hallisches Schwein; Italy: Apulo Calabrese, Casertana, Cinta Senese, Mora Romagnola, Nero Siciliano, Sarda; Lithuania: Indigenous Wattle, White Old Type; Portugal: Alentejana, Bisara; Serbia: Moravka, Swallow-Bellied Mangalitsa; Slovenia: Krskopolje pig; Spain: Iberian, Majorcan Black), and three commercial breeds (Duroc, Landrace and Large White) were sampled and genotyped with the GeneSeek Genomic Profiler (GGP) 70 K HD porcine genotyping chip. A dataset of 51 Wild Boars from nine countries was also added, summing up to 1186 pigs (similar to 49 pigs/breed). The aim was to: (i) investigate individual admixture ancestries and (ii) assess breed traceability via discriminant analysis on principal components (DAPC). Albeit the mosaic of shared ancestries found for Nero Siciliano, Sarda and Moravka, admixture analysis indicated independent evolvement for the rest of the breeds. High prediction accuracy of DAPC mark SNP data as a reliable solution for the traceability of breed-specific pig products.

AB The purpose of this study was to optimize the coating process of food-grade tracers to manufacture tracers with good physical, mechanical and practical properties and an excellent appearance. The effects of the coating weight gain (1.00%-5.00%), coating solution spray rate (1.50-7.50 g/min) and tablet bed temperature (30 degrees C-40 degrees C) on the coating appearance quality, moisture absorption rate, friction coefficient, peak shear force, breaking rate, barcode recognition rate, transport wear rate and transport recognition rate were analysed using a Box-Behnken design (BBD) of response surface methodology (RSM). The experimental data were fitted to quadratic polynomial models by multiple regression analysis. The mathematical models of the barcode recognition rate, transport wear rate and transport recognition rate exhibited no statistically significant difference in these data. The optimum coating parameters were as follows: a 5.00% coating weight gain, spray rate of 5.47 g/min and tablet bed temperature of 35.42 degrees C. Under the optimized conditions, the tracers had a good appearance (coating appearance quality), moisture resistance (moisture absorption rate), and frictional (friction coefficient), compression (peak shear force), and impact characteristics (breaking rate).

TI Italian Tracing System for Water Buffalo Milk and Processed Milk

ID MOZZARELLA CHEESE; PERFORMANCE; QUALITY
AB Simple Summary As buffalo milk is important in Italy, especially in the southern regions where Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) buffalo mozzarella from Campania is produced, the need has arisen to trace the path of milk from the farm to the dairy. We aimed to verify the applicability of a buffalo tracing system throughout the national territory, following the Ministerial Decree of 9 September 2014. Use of the online system is mandatory for breeders, dairies, and intermediaries, and is required to record and communicate all milk that is produced, bought, and sold. In Italy, the number of registrations is more representative in the Campania region, which has the highest concentration of dairy buffalo herds; for the other regions, the number of farms registered in the system is less representative. The system highlights that the circuit of non-PDO products absorbs 35% of the total milk produced, while 65% of the milk is processed in PDO dairies, which allows for the control of milk production throughout the territory and facilitates the control of milk that proceeds to be frozen or that can only be used in non-PDO productions; this increases the transparency of the supply chain. The system is a computerized archive of the productions for all the operators in the sector. This document describes the development of a tracing system for the buffalo supply chain, namely an online computer system in which farmers, dairies, and brokers must maintain records of the production of milk through to the production of derivatives. The system is jointly used throughout the Italian national territory by the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale del Mezzogiorno (IZSM) and the Sistema Informativo Agricolo Nazionale Italiano (SIAN), after being made mandatory and regulated with the publication of the Ministerial Decree of 9 September 2014. Farmers are obligated to communicate their daily production of bulk milk, the number of animals milked, the number of the delivery note of the sale, and the name of the purchaser; within the first week of the month, they must communicate the milk production of each animal milked. Dairies are required to communicate the milk and the processed product (mozzarella, yogurt, etc.) purchased on a daily basis. The intermediaries are required to communicate the daily milk purchased, both fresh and frozen, the semi-finished product, and the sale of the same. The tracing system linked to the project authorized by the Ministry of Health, called "Development, validation and verification of the applicability of an IT system to be used for the management of traceability in the buffalo industry", provides operators with the monitoring of production and sales in real time through alerts and access logs. Currently, there are 1531 registered farmers, 601 non-PDO dairies, 102 PDO dairies, 68 non-PDO intermediaries, and 17 PDO intermediaries in Italy. The system provides support for the recovery of the buffalo sector; from the analysis of the data extrapolated from the tracing system of the buffalo supply chain for the years 2016 to 2019, this paper highlights that the application of the Ministerial Decree No. 9406 of 9 September 2014 and the tracing of the supply chain have increased the price of buffalo milk at barns from EUR 1.37/kg to EUR 1.55/kg from 2016 to 2019.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to solve new pricing issues faced by low-carbon companies in the Yellow River Basin, which is caused by the change of key pricing factors in the mixed appliance background of Big Data and blockchain, such as product quality and carbon-emission reduction CER level (hereafter, CER level). Design/methodology/approach We choose a low-carbon supply chain with a low-carbon manufacturer and a retailer as our research object. Then, we propose that using the ineffective effect of the CER level and the quality and safety level to reflect the relationships among the CER level, the quality and safety level and the market demand is more suitable in the new environment. Based on these, we revise the demand equation. Afterwards, by using Stackelberg game, four cost-sharing situations and their pricing rules are analyzed. Findings Results indicated that in the four cost-sharing situations, the change trends and the magnitudes of the best retail prices were not affected by the changes of the inputs of the demand information and the traceability services costs (hereafter, DITS costs), the proportion about retailer's DITS costs undertaken by the manufacturer, the ineffective effect coefficient of the CER level and the quality and safety level and the cost optimization coefficient. However, the cost-sharing situations could affect the change magnitudes of the best revenues. Originality/value This paper has two main contributions. First, this paper proposes a demand function that is more suitable for the mixed appliance background of Big Data and blockchain. Secondly, this paper improves the cost-sharing model and finds that demand information sharing and traceability service sharing have different impacts on key pricing factors of low-carbon product. In addition, this research provides a theoretical reference for low-carbon supply chain members to formulate pricing strategies in the new background.

AB To solve the problem of unreliability of traceability information in the traceability system, we developed an intelligent monitoring system to realize the real-time online acquisition of physicochemical parameters of the agricultural inputs and to predict the varieties of input products accurately. Firstly, self-developed monitoring equipment was used to realize real-time acquisition, format conversion and pretreatment of the physicochemical parameters of inputs, and real-time communication with the cloud platform server. In this process, LoRa technology was adopted to solve the wireless communication problems between long-distance, low-power, and multinode environments. Secondly, a deep belief network (DBN) model was used to learn unsupervised physicochemical parameters of input products and extract the input features. Finally, these input features were utilized on the softmax classifier to establish the classification model, which could accurately predict the varieties of agricultural inputs. The results showed that when six kinds of pesticides, chemical fertilizers, and other agricultural inputs were predicted through the system, the prediction accuracy could reach 98.5%. Therefore, the system can be used to monitor the varieties of agrarian inputs effectively and use in real-time to ensure the authenticity and accuracy of the traceability information.

AB Traceability of seafood is a much needed service for the seafood industry. Current ways of tracing seafood are minimal while tracing of shellfish is nearly nonexistent. Tracing fish and shellfish are necessary for indicating where the fish and shellfish were fished from, farmed and packed from. This study reviews history of traceability of aquaculture and analytical approaches to verify the origin of seafood. It then describes the new molecular technique of the traceability by using PCR-DGGE to discriminate the geographical origin of fish (cases studies of Pangasius fish from Viet Nam and Sea bass fish from France) by analysis the DNA fragments of microorganisms (bacteria) on fish. This method is based on the assumption that the microbial communities of food are specific to a geographic area.

AB We analyze the economic impacts of changes in age and source verification requirements and associated adjustments in international trade of US beef using an equilibrium displacement model. Because the United States lags behind many countries in adopting animal traceability systems, the United States risks losing export market access. The loss of an export market the size of South Korea's would cause a decline of US meat industry producer surplus of $1751 million over 10 years or 0.23% of its10-year cumulative discounted present value. Additionally, we find that only small increases in US beef exports would be necessary to offset direct costs associated with adoption of age and source verification. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Origin is an important environmental factor affecting crop production, and tracing the origin is of great significance for food safety. The chemical analysis method is generally used in traditional agricultural product origin detection, and its operation is cumbersome, destructive and time-consuming. In this study, northern cold mung beans were used as the research object. Near-infrared spectral data of mung bean in two states of seed and powder were obtained in the main origins of high-quality for Baicheng, Dumeng and Tailai. A new nondestructive detecting method for mung bean origins were established by optimizing the NIR characteristic spectrum wavenumbers. Firstly, in the range of 10 105.37 similar to 4 078.655 cm(-1) wavenumber with strong absorbance value, the raw spectral data of mung beans from different regions was preprocessed by using multivariate scattering correction (MSC) method to eliminate spectral interference information. Then competitive adaptive reweighted sampling(CARS) algorithm is applied to optimize the characteristic spectral wavenumbers of mung bean seed and powder states from different origins to reduce the feature vector dimension of the spectral curve. Finally, a feed-forward neural network (BP) adaptive inference mechanism was used to establish a non-linear mapping model between the origin of mung bean and its spectral characteristic wavenumber, and the encoding vector output by the network was parsed to the original name as the output result of the detection of the origin of the mung bean. The results show that; (1)Preprocessed with multiple scattering corrections in the raw spectral, the error of the spectral curve of mung bean powder is reduced from 12.87 to 3.20, and the error of the spectral curve of mung bean seed is reduced from 153.04 to 27.73, which provides effective and reliable spectral data. (2) Through the competitive adaptive reweighting sampling algorithm, the important characteristic wavenumbers of mung bean spectral curve are extracted. From the 2 114 original wavenumbers of seed and powder state, 61 and 107 characteristic wavenumbers are optimized respectively, and the total number of wavebands is reduced by 94.94%, which is taken as the characteristic index of mung bean origin recognition. (3) The MSC-CARS-BP mung bean origin detection model was put forward innovatively. Based on the optimized spectral characteristic wavenumber as the quantitative basis, the origin detection of mung bean seed and powder was carried out respectively. The accuracy of the prediction set was 92.59% and 98.63%, and the correlation coefficient was above 0.99. This method can use near-infrared spectrum processing technology to achieve the goal of non-destructive detecting of mung bean origin, and provide technical support and reference for automatic and rapid traceability of agricultural products origin.

AB The establishment of a reference method for the determination of the allergen protein content in a processed food material has been explored. An analytical approach was developed to enable the comparability of food allergen measurement results expressed in a decision-relevant manner. A proof of concept is here presented, resulting in quantity values for the common measurand, namely 'mass of total allergen protein per mass of food'. The quantities are determined with SI traceability to enable the comparability of reported results. A method for the quantification of total milk protein content in an incurred baked food at a concentration level clinically relevant is presented. The strategy on how to obtain the final analytical result is outlined. Challenges associated with this method are discussed, in particular the optimal extraction of the marker proteins, the complete digestion and release of the peptides in an equimolar fashion, the use of conversion factors to translate the amount of measured proteins into total milk protein and the estimation of the uncertainty contributions as well as of the combined uncertainty of the final result. The implementation of such a reference method for the determination of the total allergen content in a processed food is an important step, which will provide comparable measurement data of relevance to risk assessors.

AB Food systems are both contributing to and affected by environmental degradation and climate change. The transition towards resilient and sustainable food systems is essential to ensure food security and minimise negative environmental impacts. Innovative technologies can accelerate this transition. Blockchain technology (BCT) is attracting attention as it can deliver transparency to complex global food supply chains and has the potential to guide current food production towards better sustainability and efficiency. This case study investigated the opportunities that BCT can offer to food supply chains. Qualitative interviews with eight main BCT providers were conducted to evaluate the current state of BCT and put it into perspective by mapping out advantages, disadvantages, incentives, motives, and expectations connected to its implementation in global food systems. A thematic analysis showed that, while BCT was considered beneficial by all interviewees, uptake is slow due to high implementation costs and the lack of incentives for companies throughout the food chain from farms to food industry and retail. Results further revealed that the advantages of BCT go beyond communication of trustworthy information and development of closer producer-consumer relationships. In fact, it can provide the opportunity to decrease food waste, enhance working conditions throughout the supply chain, and promote sustainable consumption habits. As BCT may be increasingly used in the food supply chain, the results give a basis for future research that may leverage both qualitative and quantitative methods to examine actors' behaviours. Also, the importance of improving user experiences through functional applications and software to facilitate the adoption of the technology is stressed.

AB Molecular food traceability requires continuous updates to identify more robust, efficient and affordable methodologies to guarantee food quality and safety and especially consumers' health. Available commercial kits are often unsatisfactory and require modifications to successfully detect single components on complex and transformed food matrices. Here we report a simple method for molecular traceability of cold-pressed hazelnut oil based on microsatellite DNA markers. Different genomic extraction methodologies were tested and a total genome pre-amplification step was applied on PCR-negative samples. PCR-capillary electrophoresis using nine microsatellites demonstrates the accuracy of the fingerprint analysis even for filtered oil.

AB The final characteristics of a wine are strongly influenced by must varietal composition. Further, wine quality and value can be heavily modified if grape varieties other than those expected/allowed are used, especially in the case of monovarietal wines. 'Moscato bianco', which is one of the main grape varieties grown in Piedmont (north-western Italy), is used for the production of two renowned monovarietal sparkling wines: Asti Spumante and Moscato d'Asti. Here, the genetic traceability of these wines was assessed using a simple sequence repeat (SSR or microsatellite) DNA-based method. Must and wine samples from two local wineries were collected at different winemaking steps: after grape crushing and pressing, without the skins (must sample 1, M1); after static clarification or flotation (M2); halfway through fermentation (M3); and finished wines. A DNA extraction protocol was developed, and samples were analysed using a set of 9 nuclear (nSSR) and 7 chloroplast (cpSSR) markers. The application of nSSR markers was successful for M1 and M2, but was inadequate for M3 and wines. CpSSR gave better results as amplifications were achieved using DNA extracted from M1, M2 and wines, despite the lack of amplification in M3. Furthermore, the amplified cpSSR loci showed high polymorphism, allowing the identification of 5 distinct chlorotypes among 7 muscat-flavoured and 2 non-aromatic grapevines. Altogether, these results suggest that this technique could be extended to wine quality and authenticity control, as well as origin protection.

AB Herbal medicine has obtained great attention for its effective efficacy using its crude materials and patent medicines. It is believed that the efficacy is a synergetic action by several chemical components. To present a detailed overview of the usage of multivariate statistical techniques developed for analytical chemistry in quality assessment and origins traceability, we provided an extensive pragmatic and practical overview of these techniques for the quality control of these crude medicines. Two pattern recognition methods, unsupervised and supervised approaches, were interpreted using practical instances. Overall, the review briefly summarized common applications for location, species, harvesting time, processed production, manufacture, botanical part, and authenticity. Besides, we focused on data pretreatment and fusion strategies listing recently published literature to provide a detailed reference to choose the most appropriate statistical method and fusion strategies. Actual applications have proved chemometrics as an effective and rapid tool for the quality control of herbal medicine.

AB Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) has elevated commercial value due to its health appeal, desirable characteristics and quantitatively limited production, and thus it has become an object of intentional adulteration. As EVOOs on the market might consist of a blend of olive varieties or sometimes even of a mixture of oils from different botanical species, an array of DNA-fingerprinting methods have been developed to check the varietal composition of the blend. Starting from a comparison between publicly available DNA extraction protocols, we set up a timely, low-cost, reproducible and effective DNA isolation protocol, which allows an adequate amount of DNA to be recovered even from commercial filtered EVOOs. Then, in order to verify the effectiveness of the DNA extraction protocol herein proposed, we applied PCR-based fingerprinting methods starting from the DNA extracted from three EVOO samples of unknown composition. In particular, genomic regions harboring nine simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and eight genotyping-by-sequencing-derived single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were amplified for authentication and traceability of the three EVOO samples. The whole investigation strategy herein described might favor producers in terms of higher revenues and consumers in terms of price transparency and food safety.

AB This paper investigates the possibility to automatically match and recognize individual Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) boards using a fusion of two feature detection methods. The first method denoted Block matching method, detects corners and matches square regions around these corners using a normalized Sum of Squared Differences (SSD) measure. The second method denoted the SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features) matching method, matches SURF features, between images (Bay et al., 2008). The fusion of the two feature detection methods improved the recognition rate of wooden floorboards substantially compared to the individual methods. Perfect matching accuracy was obtained for board pieces with more than 20 knots using high quality images. More than 90% matching accuracy was achieved for board pieces with more than 10 knots, using both high- and low quality images. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Over the last decade, isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) using up to 5 light stable isotopes (C-13/C-12, H-2/H-1, N-15/N-14, O-18/O-16, S-34/S-32) has become more widely applied for food origin verification as well as food authentication in China. IRMS technology is increasingly used to authenticate a range of food products including organic foods, honey, beverages, tea, animal products, fruits, oils, cereals, spices and condiments that are frequently unique to a specific region of China. Compared to other food authenticity and traceability techniques, IRMS has been successfully used to characterize, classify and identify many Chinese food products, reducing fraud and food safety problems and improving consumer trust and confidence. IRMS techniques also provides scientific support to enhance China's strict government regulatory policies. Isotope testing verifies geographical origin labelling of domestic and imported foods, protects and verifies high value foods that are unique to China, and indicates environmentally friendly farming practices such as 'green' or 'organic' methods. This paper reviews recently published Chinese research to highlight the recent advances of IRMS as a regulatory and verification tool for Chinese food products.

AB The conventional procedures, based on attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (ATR-FTIR), have been developed for the origins traceability of cultivated Paris polyphylla Smith var. yunnanensis (PPY) samples with the help of partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and random forest. In this study, a set of 219 batch cultivated PPY samples, containing the cultivation years of 5, 6 and 7, and covering the municipal districts of Chuxiong, Dali, Honghe, Lijiang and Yuxi in Yunnan Province, China, were used to build the discrimination models. Firstly, a visualized analysis was carried out by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to reduce each data point in a two-dimensional map and make a knowledge of the sample distribution tendency. Secondly, the single spectra data sets of Paridis rhizome and leaf tissues, and the combination of these two data sets with variable selection (mid-level data fusion strategy), were used to establish PLS-DA and random forest models, and parallelly compared the model performance. Results demonstrated that the discrimination ability of PLS-DA preceded the random forest model, and the classification performance was remarkably improved after mid-level data fusion. These results verified each other by 5-, 6- and 7-year old Paridis samples and indicated that the model performance established in the present study was reliable. Besides, five agronomic characters, including the plant height, dry weight of rhizome and leaf tissues, and the allocation of rhizome and leaf were determined and analyzed, results of which indicated that the dry weight and their allocation was significantly different among various origins and fluctuated with the cultivation years. This study was using a comprehensive and green analytical method to discriminate the cultivated Paridis according to their provenances, which was simultaneously benefited for the appropriate cultivation areas selection based on the dry weight of rhizome tissues.

AB Diagnostic tests for grapevine viruses subjected to phytosanitary rules involve a heavy workload for plant protection services and laboratories. Propagation schemes enable nurseries, where mother plants (MPs) are cultivated, to be linked to batches of certified plants (CPs). This approach entails post-production checks of MPs once infection occurs in CPs. However, this traceability system is not tight and follow ups are demanding. This study assessed radio frequency identification (RFID) tagging of plants in terms of its ability to reduce laboratory workloads for nursery health checks. RFID-tagged plants (RFID-CPs) were produced from individually tagged MPs (RFID-MPs) or row-tagged MPs (RFID-ROW, a less expensive approach). In a 10-year case study, the health status of CPs and RFID-CPs were assessed and the occurrence of infections then led to health checks in MPs, RFID-MPs or RFID-ROWs. Laboratory workloads were evaluated by considering two sampling methods (single or pool sampling). Using single sampling, the workload was reduced by 93-98% in RFID-ROW or RFID-MP checks compared to the conventional approach. Considerable reductions in workload due to the tagging system (93-96%) were also observed using pool sampling. Traceability of CPs and MPs using RFID reduces laboratory workloads, and supports emergency measures that can be taken to stop any unsafe sales of plants after a virus outbreak.

AB The lack of regulations and serious enforcement in the traceability of fishery products in some countries is one cause of food fraud, especially species substitution. Thailand is one of those countries where regulations are not fully enforced. Therefore, the labeling situation needs to be investigated in fish fillet products. Fifty-four products were collected from several supermarkets in Thailand. The labeling and molecular identity of each product were assessed by the application of a DNA barcoding technique on a cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene fragment of approximately 650 bp. All samples were successfully identified at the species level with 98-100% similarity in both the GenBank and BOLD databases. Only one sample could be identified at the genus level because the highest COI sequence match in the database was reported only at the genus level. Among all products, there were 25 species and 18 genera. Only one species, Pangasianodon hypophthalmus, was assessed as an endangered species according to IUCN status. FishBase was utilized to investigate the scientific names from common or market names. Two criteria were used to determine mislabeling, including i) mismatches between the scientific name identified by DNA barcoding and product labels and ii) the absence of common or market names in FishBase. Eighteen samples (33.33%) were mislabeled, which included 16 samples (88.89%) and 2 samples (11.11%) for criteria 1 and 2, respectively. Only one (11.11%) of nine products labeled with scientific names was mislabeled. Therefore, labeling products with scientific names may be a tool to reduce mislabeling to protect consumer rights.

AB Background: DNA typing is increasingly being applied to assess the genetic origin and authenticity of products entering and exiting the food supply chain. The growing interest in DNA typing has arisen from an expanding array of contexts, such as the need to protect manufacturers, ensure compliance with food regulations, validate labels, fight misbranding, evaluate product ingredients and defend consumers' rights and freedom of choice.
   Scope and approach: This review presents current practices and emerging technologies about the genetic traceability in the agro-food chain, providing an overview of the specificity and challenges related to the analysis of commercial products of plant origin. We also discuss unsolved needs and specific features of DNA testing in the agro-food supply chain. These include the biochemical and physical variability of the samples under investigation, the possible DNA degradation, and the necessity to distinguish among plant varieties and not only different species.
   Key findings and conclusions: We acknowledge that a number of DNA typing systems have been successfully used, and the vast majority are based on the PCR technique. Advances in next-generation sequencing technologies are expected to greatly expand data range and the amount of information accessible to a DNA analysis. The evaluation and implementation of novel technologies and tools, along with concerted efforts to increase information sharing and to establish standard operating protocols, are main priorities of genetic typing in the agro-food chain.

AB Introduction Wolfiporia cocos, as a kind of medicine food homologous fungus, is well-known and widely used in the world. Therefore, quality and safety have received worldwide attention, and there is a trend to identify the geographic origin of herbs with artificial intelligence technology. Objective This research aimed to identify the geographical traceability for different parts of W. cocos. Methods The exploratory analysis is executed by two multivariate statistical analysis methods. The two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS) images combined with residual convolutional neural network (ResNet) and partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models were established to identify the different parts and regions of W. cocos. We compared and analysed 2DCOS images with different fingerprint bands including full band, 8900-6850 cm(-1), 6300-5150 cm(-1) and 4450-4050 cm(-1) of original spectra and the second-order derivative (SD) spectra preprocessed. Results From all results: the exploratory analysis results showed that t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding was better than principal component analysis. The synchronous SD 2DCOS is more suitable for the identification and analysis of complex mixed systems for the small-band for Poria and Poriae cutis. Both models of PLS-DA and ResNet could successfully identify the geographical traceability of different parts based on different bands. The 10% external verification set of the ResNet model based on synchronous 2DCOS can be accurately identified. Conclusion Therefore, the methods could be applied for the identification of geographical origins of this fungus, which may provide technical support for quality evaluation.

AB Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) represents a crucial ingredient of the Mediterranean diet. Being a first-choice product, consumers should be guaranteed its quality and geographical origin, justifying the high purchasing cost. For this reason, it is important to have new reliable tools able to classify products according to their geographical origin. The aim of this work was to demonstrate the efficiency of an open source visible and near infra-red (VIS-NIR) spectrophotometer, relying on a specific app, in assessing olive oil geographical origin. Thus, 67 Italian and 25 foreign EVOO samples were analyzed and their spectral data were processed through an artificial intelligence algorithm. The multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) results reported significant differences (p< 0.001) between the Italian and foreign EVOO VIS-NIR matrices. The artificial neural network (ANN) model with an external test showed a correct classification percentage equal to 94.6%. Both the MANOVA and ANN tested methods showed the most important spectral wavelengths ranges for origin determination to be 308-373 nm and 594-605 nm. These are related to the absorption of phenolic components, carotenoids, chlorophylls, and anthocyanins. The proposed tool allows the assessment of EVOO samples' origin and thus could help to preserve the "Made in Italy" from fraud and sophistication related to its commerce.

AB Achieving transition towards sustainable and resilient food systems is a critical issue on the current societal agenda. This study examined the potential contribution of digitalization of the food system to such transition by reviewing 76 relevant journal articles, indexed on the Scopus database, using the integrative literature review approach and descriptive content analysis with MAXQDA 2020 software. 'Blockchain' was the top hit among keywords and main concepts applied to the food system. The UK as a country and Europe as a continent were found to lead the scientific research on food system digitalization. Use of digital technologies such as blockchain, the Internet of Things, big-data analytics, artificial intelligence, and related information and communications technologies were identified as enablers. Traceability, sustainability, resilience to crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and reducing food waste were among the key benefit areas associated with digitalization for different food commodities. Challenges to practical applications related to infrastructure and cost, knowledge and skill, law and regulations, the nature of the technologies, and the nature of the food system were identified. Developing policies and regulations, supporting infrastructure development, and educating and training people could facilitate fuller digitalization of the food system.

AB Due to ever-evolving software developments processes, companies are motivated to develop desired quality products quickly and effectively. Industries are now focusing on the delivery of configurable systems to provide several services to a wide range of customers by making different configurations in a single largest system. Nowadays, component-based systems are highly demanded due to their capability of reusability and restructuring of existing components to develop new systems. Moreover, product line engineering is the major branch of the component-based system for developing a series of systems. Software product line engineering (SPLE) provides the ability to design several software modifications according to customer needs in a cost-effective manner. Researchers are trying to tailor the software product line (SPL) process that integrates agile development technologies to overcome the issues faced during the execution of the SPL process such as delay in product delivery, restriction to requirements change, and exhaustive initial planning. The selection of suitable components, the need for documentation, and tracing back the user requirements in the agile-integrated product line (APL) models still need to improve. Furthermore, configurable systems demand the selected features to be the least dependent. In this paper, a hybrid APL model, quality enhanced application product line engineering (QeAPLE) is proposed that provides support for highly configurable systems (HCS) by evaluating the dependency of features before making the final selection. It also has a documentation and requirement traceability function to ensure that the product meets the desired quality. Two-fold assessments are undertaken to validate the suggested model, with the proposed model being deployed on an active project. After that, we evaluated the proposed model performance and effectiveness using after implementing it in a real-world environment and compared the results with an existing method using statistical analysis. The results of the experimental study proofs that the proposed model is practically and statistically significant as compared to the existing method in terms of effectiveness and participants' performance. Hence, the statistical results of the comparative analysis show that the proposed model improved ease of understanding and adaptability, required effort, high-quality achievement, and version management are significant i.e., more the 50% as compared to the exiting method i.e., less than 50%. The proposed model offers to assist in the development of a highly configurable system that achieves the needed quality. Therefore, the proposed model manages the variation identification, versions control, components dependency for correct selection of components, and validation activities from domain engineering to application engineering.

AB Farmed oysters are one of the most valuable aquacultured products in the United States (U.S.), are highly perishable, and increasingly shipped live year-round. Supply chain actors must work together to bring refrigerated oysters to market quickly, while maintaining product value, safety and traceability information. In light of these demands, this study assesses the performance and conduct of supply chains for U.S. farmed oysters (Crassostrea virginica, C. gigas). Over the two-year study period, we conducted interviews with 56 businesses and tracked 125 oyster shipments from two major growing regions in the U.S. through six different types of supply chains. We hypothesized that direct and intermediated supply chains would perform differently in terms of timeto-market, product temperature in cold chains, compliance with temperature regulations, and modeled risks from Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Intermediated supply chains, by their definition have more connections than direct supply chains, and we found this introduces a longer time-to-market and a higher incidence of time and temperature abuse. However, these factors did not lead to greater modeled V. parahaemolyticus risks. Participants in both direct and intermediated supply chains were aware of the importance of traceability and felt uniformly positive about their ability to perform recalls. A common concern was the speed of government-imposed recalls, which can be declared by regulators after the affected live oysters are consumed. Members of these supply chains play different roles in maintaining the cold chain, possess different levels of information related to traceability, and describe different levels of trust with other supply chain actors. This paper contributes to a growing body of knowledge on supply chains for seafood and their critical, and sometimes overlooked, role in larger food systems.

AB The creation of a centralised national livestock database for the islands of Malta and Gozo is of crucial importance for the identification and traceability of bovines. It is also important for compliance with the legal obligations that followed Malta's accession to the European Union in May 2004. This paper describes how the processes of identification, registration and traceability of bovines have changed since Malta's accession. The validation and integration of data originating from different departmental sections (such as the identification and registration section), the slaughterhouse and the National Veterinary Laboratory, ensures that any discrepancies are highlighted and can be investigated. Events recorded in the database enable the compliance and eligibility of bovine producers to be cross-checked when applications for European Union benefits are made. The main drawbacks and weak points of the system include financial costs for the government department, potentially late notification of the births and deaths of newborn calves, and insufficient uptake among bovine producers of the latest technology for notification of events such as births, deaths and movement of bovines.

AB Objectives Shea tree is a multi-purpose tree daily used by rural African communities. Economic importance of Shea tree fruits has been rising and achieving a great success in African, American and European markets. Shea butter is used mainly in chocolate industry, cosmetic or pharmacological products. Traceability is now one of the great concerns of the customers and the lawyers. In view of the difficulties of installing these documentary systems in developing country particularly the countries of sub-Saharan Africa, the new strategies of traceability emerge. Methods Molecular technique using 28S rDNA profiles generated by polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to detect the variation in fungal community structures of Shea tree fruit from Senegal, Mali and Cameroon. Results 28S rDNA profiles were analysed by multivariate analysis, distinct microbial communities were detected. Band profiles of Shea tree fruit fungi from different countries were specific for each location and could be used as a bar code to discriminate the origin of fruits. Conclusion We propose the polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis method as the fingerprinting of Shea tree fruits using 28S rDNA of fungi that provides the fruits with a unique bar code and make it possible to trace back the Shea tree fruit to their original locations.

AB Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined with chemometric tools was utilized as a rapid analysis method to assess quality and to differentiate geographical origins of black tea. A partial least squares (PLS) algorithm was employed for the calibration of models predicting the levels of caffeine, water extract, total polyphenols, and free amino acids, while a factorization method was proposed to trace black tea from different geographical origins. In the calibration set, the root mean squared error of cross validation (%) and the correlation coefficient (R) for caffeine, water extracts, total polyphenols and free amino acids were 0.102%, 0.654%, 0.552%, and 0.248% and 0.983, 0.977, 0.975, and 0.943, respectively. In the prediction set, the root mean squared error of prediction and R for the corresponding constituents were 0.160%, 0.685%, 0.594%, and 0273% and 0.955, 0.962, 0.954, and 0.927, respectively. The identification accuracy for black tea from different geographical origins reached 94.3%. This study demonstrated that NIR spectroscopy can be successfully applied to rapidly determine the main chemical compositions and geographical origins of black tea. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This chapter highlights the importance of communication and related challenges based on consumer data from several EU-funded research projects dealing with traditional foods, beef, pork and seafood. Apart from intrinsic food qualities relating to safety and healthiness, emerging ethical issues are also recognised. Consumers are open to receiving additional and easily accessible food quality reassurance. This can be done through labelling or on-label indications that are backed up and guaranteed by trustworthy traceability systems that underscore the supply chains' integrity.

AB Qualitative and DNA analysis can be performed by taking a multidisciplinary approach to evaluate apple juices, the relevant values of which are a function of the origin, processing method and cultivar used. In detail, the aims of this study were to characterize apple juices through physiochemical analysis, sensory analysis and DNA analysis to evaluate the efficiency of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers for cultivar identification. Six apple juices made with cv Golden Delicious, cv Granny Smith and a mix of these cultivars from an e-commerce platform (Samples A and B), DISAFA (Samples C and D) and a local farm (Piedmont, Italy) (Samples E and F) were considered. Apple juices A, B, E and F (clarified and pasteurized) can be considered as being of high quality, while Samples C and D were unclarified, unpasteurized and made with apples purchased from a local store. Considering the qualitative analysis, it was observed that the cultivar of apple affected the parameters assessed. In the case of total phenolic compounds, the highest values were observed for juices made only with cv Granny Smith, suggesting how this cultivar contributes to maintaining these nutraceutical compounds more than cv Golden Delicious. Regarding DNA analysis, a limited number of markers, i.e., 4 and 3, respectively, for the apple juices originating from e-commerce and a local farm could successfully produce reproducible amplified fragments. These results can be related to the different procedures used in processing apple juices of different origins.

AB BACKGROUND Flaxseed is an economically important oilseed crop whose geographic origin is of significant interest to producers and consumers because every region may exhibit particular quality characteristics. The lipid/fatty acid method of determining the geographic origin of flaxseed has not been found to be adequate. RESULTS To improve the discrimination rate and the geographical traceability of this crop, the chemical profiles of the flaxseed samples were characterized via lipids/fatty acids, stable isotopes, and antioxidant capacity. Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were also performed. A satisfactory discrimination rate of 98.6% was obtained after combining fatty acids, stable isotopes, and antioxidant capacity to trace the origin of flaxseed from five regions in northern China. CONCLUSION This study provides an effective method for distinguishing the geographic origin of flaxseed. (c) 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB This study describes the use of simulation modelling to evaluate the predicted benefits of an effective livestock traceability system in responding to a hypothetical introduction of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in to the province of Alberta, Canada, and whether or not the implementation of emergency ring vaccination in addition to a standard stamping-out (SO) strategy would lead to smaller and shorter epidemics. Three introduction scenarios were defined, with the primary case in either an intensive beef feedlot operation, an extensive cow-calf operation or in a swine operation. Disease spread was simulated using, three levels of tracing effectiveness, five types of vaccination zone, three different vaccination start times, three lengths of vaccination campaigns, two levels of culling resource and using FMD strains with two different virulence levels. Using standard SO procedures (without vaccination), improving traceability effectiveness from a level whereby only 65% of movements were traced within 5-7 days, to a capability whereby all movements were traced within 1 day, led to a reduction in the number of infected premises (IPs) between 18.7 and 64.5%, an average saving of CAN$29,000,000 in livestock compensation costs alone, and a reduction in the length of epidemics ranging from 1 to 22 days. The implementation of emergency vaccination also led to a reduction in the number of IPs and a shortening of epidemics. The effects were more pronounced when the higher virulence settings were used, with a predicted reduction in IPs of 16.6-68.7% (mean= 48.6%) and epidemics shortened by up to 37 days. Multi-variable analyses showed these effects were highly significant, after accounting for the incursion location, virulence of virus and time of first detection. The results clearly demonstrated the benefits of having effective traceability systems with rapid query and reporting functionality. The results also supported the value of early vaccination as an adjunct to SO in reducing the number of IPs and shortening the length of the epidemics. The most effective vaccination strategy involved a 3 km or larger suppressive vaccination zone around all IPs, begun as soon as practicable after first detection, and which continued until the last IF was detected.

AB Organic agriculture sparks a lively debate on its potential health and environmental benefits. Comparative studies often investigate the response of crops to organic farming through targeted approaches and within a limited experimental work. To clarify this issue, the transcriptomic profile of a cultivar of the potato grown for two years under organic and conventional farming was compared with the profile of an experimental clone grown in the same location of Southern Italy for one year. Transcriptomic raw data were obtained through Potato Oligo Chip Initiative (POCI) microarrays and were processed using unsupervised coupling multivariate statistical analysis and bioinformatics (MapMan software). One-hundred-forty-four genes showed the same expression in both years, and 113 showed the same expression in both genotypes. Their functional characterization revealed the strong involvement of the farming system in metabolism associated with the nutritional aspects of organic tubers (e.g., phenylpropanoid, flavonoid, glycoalcaloid, asparagine, ascorbic acid). Moreover, further investigation showed that eight of 42,034 features exhibited the same trend of expression irrespective of the year and genotype, making them possible candidates as markers of traceability. This paper raises the issue regarding the choice of genotype in organic management and the relevance of assessing seasonal conditions effects when studying the effects of organic cultivation on tuber metabolism.

AB The establishment of appropriate analytical methods to authenticate the geographic origin of poultry meat independent of paper record becomes especially important nowadays. In this study, data were analyzed in terms of both the contents of two stable isotopes (C and N) and 12 mineral elements of chicken samples from four provinces to trace their geographical origin. The results showed that classification of chicken was improved by combining both types of data, as compared to that using the mineral element data alone. The present study demonstrates that it is possible to indicate the poultry origin by applying stable isotope and multi-element analysis, which is an effective tool to trace the geographic origin of poultry.

AB The potential approach of classifying foxtail millet according to geographical origin was investigated using mineral element and chemical composition analysis of samples from various provinces in China. Total 16 mineral elements and five chemical compositions of foxtail millets were analyzed. There were significant differences in 12 elements of millets from different regions. Notable differences were also observed for chemical composition, with Hebei samples showing higher protein content, Henan samples showing higher fat and ash contents and Shandong samples showed higher dietary fiber and amylose contents. Based on the combination of both methods, discriminant analysis provided optimal discrimination among the various geographical origins with a 95.2% classification rate. Our study provides an effective tool to trace the foxtail millet geographic origin through a combination of multi-element and chemical composition analysis.

AB The purpose of this work was to develop a PCR method for the identification of Cynara cardunculus used in the elaboration of "Torta del Casar" cheese. One hundred five specimens were collected from different parts of the Extremadura region (Spain). Morphological characterisation was performed in situ at the time of sampling. Comparison of the morphological data was by genotypic characterisation. Different genetic profiles were obtained using seven random primers with the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique obtaining better results with the primer OPAE10. For the simple sequence repeat (SSR) technique, ten microsatellites were used, the best genetic profiles being obtained with the microsatellite CMAFLP-24. All the specimens were analysed with both primers, showing that the method provided a fast and accurate characterisation of C. cardunculus that could be used for the Protected Designation of Origin "Torta del Casar" as a tool for traceability and control in the process of elaboration of the cheese. Thistles with different genetic profiles were used in cheese-making finding that this is a good tool to monitorisation for quality control of cheese texture characteristics elaborated with these rennets.

AB The increasing number of rice product safety issues and the potential for contamination have established an enormous need for an effective strategy for the traceability of the rice supply chain. Tracing the origins of a rice product from raw materials to end customers is very complex and costly. Existing food supply chain methods (for example, rice) do not provide a scalable and cost-effective means of agricultural food supply. Besides, consumers lack the capability and resources required to check or report on the quality of agricultural goods in terms of defects or contamination. Consequently, customers are forced to decide whether to utilize or discard the goods. However, blockchain is an innovative framework capable of offering a transformative solution for the traceability of agricultural products and food supply chains. The aim of this paper is to propose a framework capable of tracking and monitoring all interactions and transactions between all stakeholders in the rice chain ecosystem through smart contracts. The model incorporates a system for customer satisfaction feedback, which enables all stakeholders to get up-to-date information on product quality, enabling them to make more informed supply chain decisions. Each transaction is documented and stored in the public ledger of the blockchain. The proposed framework provides a safe, efficient, reliable, and effective way to monitor and track rice products safety and quality especially during product purchasing. The security and performance analysis results shows that the proposed framework outperform the benchmark techniques in terms of cost-effectiveness, security and scalability with low computational overhead.

AB "Long-storage" tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is a niche product typical of the Mediterranean area, traditionally cultivated under no water supply, the fruits of which combine a good taste with excellent nutritional properties. High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detection and electron spray-mass spectrometry (HPLC/DAD/ESI-MS) was used to identify the phenolic profile in 10 landraces of long-storage tomato, grown under a typical semiarid climate, as compared to a processing tomato hybrid cultivated in the same environment, under both well-irrigated and unirrigated conditions. Sixteen different secondary metabolites, belonging to the classes of cinnamoylquinic acids and flavonoids, were identified. Quantitative analyses were also performed to monitor the changes in the phenolic content along the batch. The results highlighted that landraces originating from the same area exhibit different fruit morphologies but own a similar biochemical profile. Moreover, the two controls (well irrigated and unirrigated) are placed into the same cluster, suggesting that these secondary metabolites in tomato fruits may be more genetics-dependent than environment-dependent. Given the analysis of phenols nowadays represents a useful tool to assess the genetic variability in tomato, these compounds could be adopted as chemotaxonomic markers in the traceability of this niche product.

AB A risk framework including four risk reduction objectives was developed to guide the selection of the most effective, least trade restrictive measures for use in phytosanitary systems approaches. Here we discuss its role in relation to control points, verification and traceability systems. Development of systems approaches is typically a two-step process, identifying and assessing measures to reduce pest risk to set a phytosanitary import requirement for a regulated article, and then agreeing on how those measures are to be implemented within a protocol or work plan. The risk framework was explicitly designed to address the first step, by classifying proposed measures according to how they reduce risk. We argue that control points, verification and traceability systems are most relevant to the implementation of protocols. Control points focus on where and when specific measures can be applied to mitigate risk, and should not be used as the basis for determining how the measures manage risk as measures applied at the one control point can manage risk in very different ways and times. Continued effort is required to develop, test and harmonise concepts that underpin phytosanitary systems approaches.

AB The Florida bass (Micropterus floridanus) is a species endemic to peninsular Florida that is held in high esteem by bass anglers for its tendency to attain a larger maximum size and aggressiveness relative to that of its sister taxon, the Northern largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides. Hatchery rearing and stocking of Florida bass outside of their native range are commonplace, particularly in the southern United States. In many cases, however, there has been minimal assessment of the persistence and success of these fish. Genetic markers are an important tool for tagging and tracing the contributions of particular lines and crosses of fish. Single nucleotide polymorophism (SNP) markers, in particular, can provide rapid and affordable genotyping of large numbers of fish. In the present study, we generated 58,450 genome-wide SNPs and population-level genotypes for Florida bass using a cost-effective genotyping-by-sequencing method. A total of 58 SNPs were shown to assign parents to offspring with 100% accuracy, irrespective of sex and with the presence of full-sib relationships. Depending on the population, sex information, and genetic relationships between parents, we also demonstrated that smaller SNP subsets may be sufficient for parentage assignment. The accuracy and assignment power of the SNP panels were found to compare favorably to those of 10 microsatellites genotyped on the same parents and progeny. This study demonstrated the utility of simple and low-cost GBS techniques for SNP discovery and the relatively small number of variable SNPs needed for accurate parentage assignment in Florida bass. The SNP resources created in this study should facilitate parentage-based research and breeding, genetic tagging, and conservation of Florida bass.

AB This work evaluated the reliability of the multivariate statistical analysis to discriminate the feeding system and the species of ruminants using their intramuscular fatty acids (FA) profile. FA composition of 53 meat samples (longissimus dorsi muscle) from animals of different species (sheep and cattle) raised with different feeding systems (pasture and stall-fed) (4 groups overall) was determined and expressed as % fatty acid methyl ester (FAME). A stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA) was applied to the full set of FA to select the variables that best discriminated between feeding systems and animal species. The selected variables were then submitted to a canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) to test the ability of those variables in discriminating against the four groups. Discriminant analysis (DA) was then exploited to classify meat samples. From the 62 initial variables detected in the FA profile, 24 were retained in the SDA. The subsequent CDA developed by using the selected variables, significantly discriminated the four groups (Hotelling's testp < 0.0001) by extracting three canonical functions. Heptadecenoic acid C17:1 c10, seemed to play a pivotal role both in discriminating species and feeding system while some 18:1 isomers (C18:1 c12, C18:1 c13 C18:1 t13/t14) together with CLA c9, t11 and omega-3 were important in discriminating feeding systems. Multivariate statistical analysis of FA was able to track both the species and the feeding system of source animals with good accuracy.

AB Implementation of molecular biotechnology, such as transgenic technologies, in forage species can improve agricultural profitability through achievement of higher productivity, better use of resources such as soil nutrients, water, or light, and reduced environmental impact. Development of detection and quantification techniques for genetically modified plants are necessary to comply with traceability and labeling requirements prior to regulatory approval for release. Real-time PCR has been the standard method used for detection and quantification of genetically modified events, and droplet digital PCR is a recent alternative technology that offers a higher accuracy. Evaluation of both technologies was performed using a transgenic high-energy forage grass as a case study. Two methods for detection and quantification of the transgenic cassette, containing modified fructan biosynthesis genes, and a selectable marker gene, hygromycin B phosphotransferase used for transformation, were developed. Real-time PCR was assessed using two detection techniques, SYBR Green I and fluorescent probe-based methods. A range of different agricultural commodities were tested including fresh leaves, tillers, seeds, pollen, silage and hay, simulating a broad range of processed agricultural commodities that are relevant in the commercial use of genetically modified pastures. The real-time and droplet digital PCR methods were able to detect both exogenous constructs in all agricultural products. However, a higher sensitivity and repeatability in transgene detection was observed with the droplet digital PCR technology. Taking these results more broadly, it can be concluded that the droplet digital PCR technology provides the necessary resolution for quantitative analysis and detection, allowing absolute quantification of the target sequence at the required limits of detection across all jurisdictions globally. The information presented here provides guidance and resources for pasture-based biotechnology applications that are required to comply with traceability requirements.

AB We analyzed consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for traceable pork, milk and cooking oil, and its determinants using data from Nanjing, China, with particular focus on the effects of consumer knowledge. The major findings suggest that Nanjing consumers are willing to pay a significant positive price premium for food traceability despite variations across products. Meanwhile, consumers' WTP for food traceability was positively affected by consumer knowledge about food traceability and awareness of food quality- and safety-related certifications. A number of demographics such as income and age also have statistically significant impacts on the WTP. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Traceability of processed food and feed products has been gaining importance due to the impact that those products can have on human/animal health and to the associated economic and legal concerns, often related to adulterations and frauds as it can be the case for meat and milk. Despite mandatory traceability requirements for the analysis of feed composition, few reliable and accurate methods are presently available to enforce the legislative frame and allow the authentication of animal feeds. In this study, nine sensitive and species-specific real-time PCR TaqMan MGB assays are described for plant species detection in animal feed samples. The method is based on selective real-time qPCR (RT-qPCR) amplification of target genes belonging to the alternative oxidase (AOX) gene family. The plant species selected for detection in feed samples were wheat, maize, barley, soybean, rice and sunflower as common components of feeds, and cotton, flax and peanut as possible undesirable contaminants. The obtained results were compared with end-point PCR methodology. The applicability of the AOX TaqMan assays was evaluated through the screening of commercial feed samples, and by the analysis of plant mixtures with known composition. The RT-qPCR methodology allowed the detection of the most abundant species in feeds but also the identification of contaminant species present in lower amounts, down to 1% w/w. AOX-based methodology provides a suitable molecular marker approach to ascertain plant species composition of animal feed samples, thus supporting feed control and enforcement of the feed sector and animal production.

AB Effective and efficient measurement and determination of critical quality parameter(s) is the key to improve the traceability and transparency of the table grapes quality as well as the sustainability performance of the table grapes cold chain logistics, and ensure the table grapes quality and safety. This paper is to determine the critical quality parameter(s) in the cold chain logistics through the real time monitoring of the temperature fluctuation implemented with the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), and the correlation analysis among the various quality parameters. The assessment was conducted through three experiments. Experiment I indicated that the temperature have a large fluctuation from 0 degrees C to 30 degrees C, and the critical temperatures could be determined as 0 degrees C, 5 degrees C, 10 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C. Experiment II described that the firmness and moisture loss rate, whose Pearson correlation coefficient with the sensory evaluation. were all greater than 0.9 at the critical temperatures determined in Experiment I, could be the critical quality parameters. Experiment III illustrated that the critical quality parameters, firmness and moisture loss rate, could be reliable indicators of table grapes quality by the Arrhenius kinetic equation, and results showed that the evaluation model based on the firmness is better to predict the shelf life than that based on the moisture loss rate. The best quality table grapes could be provided for the consumers via the easily and directly tracing and controlling the critical quality parameters in real time in actual cold chain logistics.

AB Cacao (Theobroma cacao L.), the source of cocoa, is an economically important tropical crop. One problem with the premium cacao market is contamination with off-types adulterating raw premium material. Accurate determination of the genetic identity of single cacao beans is essential for ensuring cocoa authentication. Using nanofluidic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping with 48 SNP markers, we generated SNP fingerprints for small quantities of DNA extracted from the seed coat of single cacao beans. On the basis of the SNP profiles, we identified an assumed adulterant variety, which was unambiguously distinguished from the authentic beans by multilocus matching. Assignment tests based on both Bayesian clustering analysis and allele frequency clearly separated all 30 authentic samples from the non-authentic samples. Distance-based principle coordinate analysis further supported these results. The nanofluidic SNP protocol, together with forensic statistical tools, is sufficiently robust to establish authentication and to verify gourmet cacao varieties. This method shows significant potential for practical application.

AB Honey is a widely used natural product and the price of honey from Apis cerana (ACH) and A. dorsata (ADH) is several times more expensive than the one from A. mellifera (AMH), thus there are increasing fraud issues reported in the market by mislabeling or mixing honeys with different entomological origins. In this study, three species-specific primers, targeting the NADH dehydrogenase 2 (ND2) region of honeybee mitochondrial DNA, were designed and tested to distinguish the entomological origin of ACH, ADH, and AMH. Molecular analysis showed that each primer set can specifically detect the ND2 region from the targeted honeybee DNA, but not from the others. The amplicon size for A. cerana, A. dorsata and A. mellifera were 224, 302, and 377 bp, respectively. Importantly, each primer set also specifically produced amplicons with expected size from the DNA prepared from honey samples with different entomological origins. The PCR adulteration test allowed detection of 1% of AMH in the mixture with either ACH or ADH. Furthermore, real-time PCR and melting curve analysis indicated the possible discrimination of origin of honey samples. Therefore, we provide the newly developed PCR-based method that can be used to determine the entomological origin of the three kinds of honey.

AB The interest in developing reliable wine authenticity schemes is a hot-topic, especially for wines with recognized added-value. In order to accomplish this goal, two dimensions need to be considered: the grapevine variety determination and the geographical provenance. The aim of this study was to develop a multidisciplinary approach applicable to wines from the sub region Melgaco and Moncao of the demarcated Vinho Verde region and from the demarcated Douro region. The proposed scheme consists on the use of DNA-based assays to detect Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) on three genes of the anthocyanin pathway (UFGT, F3H and LDOX) coupled with High-resolution melting (HRM) analysis aiming the varietal identification. The Alvarinho wines revealed to have the same haplotype using this marker set, demonstrating its applicability for genetic identification. In addition, to assess their geographical provenance, a multi-elemental approach using Sr and Pb isotopic ratios of wine, soil and bedrock samples was used. The isotopic data suggest a relation between Sr and Pb uptake by vine roots and soil's texture and clay content, rather than with the whole rock's isotopic ratios, but also highlights the potential of a discriminating method based on the combination of selected isotopic signatures.

AB In recent years, due to the increasing consciousness of food safety and human health, much progress has been made in developing rapid and nondestructive techniques for the evaluation of food hazards, food authentication, and traceability. Near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and imaging techniques have gained wide acceptance in many fields because of their advantages over other analytical techniques. Following a brief introduction of NIR spectroscopy and imaging basics, this review mainly focuses on recent NIR spectroscopy and imaging applications for food safety evaluation, including (1) chemical hazards detection; (2) microbiological hazards detection; (3) physical hazards detection; (4) new technology-induced food safety concerns; and (5) food traceability. The review shows NIR spectroscopy and imaging to be effective tools that will play indispensable roles for food safety evaluation. In addition, on-line/real-time applications of these techniques promise to be a huge growth field in the near future.

AB Traceability is now one of the great concerns of the customers and the food regulators. We proposed a new analytical molecular method based on the analysis in a universal way of the microbial communities of food that we linked statistically to its geographical origin. 28S rDNA profiles generated by PCR-DGGE were used to detect the variation in fungal communities of three species of Physalis fruit (Physalis ixocarpa Brot, Physalis pubescens L, and Physalis pruinosa L) from four Egyptian regions (Qalyoubia, Minufiya, Beheira, and Alexandria). The fungal profiles of Physalis from different regions were specific for each location and could be used as a unique biological bar code to discriminate the origin of fruits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper describing a molecular method of fungal ecology to determine the fruit origin by using 28S rDNA fingerprinting of fungi.

AB The national infrastructure FoodOmicsGR_RI coordinates research efforts from eight Greek Universities and Research Centers in a network aiming to support research and development (R&D) in the agri-food sector. The goals of FoodOmicsGR_RI are the comprehensive in-depth characterization of foods using cutting-edge omics technologies and the support of dietary/nutrition studies. The network combines strong omics expertise with expert field/application scientists (food/nutrition sciences, plant protection/plant growth, animal husbandry, apiculture and 10 other fields). Human resources involve more than 60 staff scientists and more than 30 recruits. State-of-the-art technologies and instrumentation is available for the comprehensive mapping of the food composition and available genetic resources, the assessment of the distinct value of foods, and the effect of nutritional intervention on the metabolic profile of biological samples of consumers and animal models. The consortium has the know-how and expertise that covers the breadth of the Greek agri-food sector. Metabolomics teams have developed and implemented a variety of methods for profiling and quantitative analysis. The implementation plan includes the following research axes: development of a detailed database of Greek food constituents; exploitation of "omics" technologies to assess domestic agricultural biodiversity aiding authenticity-traceability control/certification of geographical/genetic origin; highlighting unique characteristics of Greek products with an emphasis on quality, sustainability and food safety; assessment of diet's effect on health and well-being; creating added value from agri-food waste. FoodOmicsGR_RI develops new tools to evaluate the nutritional value of Greek foods, study the role of traditional foods and Greek functional foods in the prevention of chronic diseases and support health claims of Greek traditional products. FoodOmicsGR_RI provides access to state-of-the-art facilities, unique, well-characterised sample sets, obtained from precision/experimental farming/breeding (milk, honey, meat, olive oil and so forth) along with more than 20 complementary scientific disciplines. FoodOmicsGR_RI is open for collaboration with national and international stakeholders.

AB In this paper, a Fourier Transform Raman spectroscopy method, to authenticate the provenience of wine, for food traceability applications was developed. In particular, due to the specific chemical fingerprint of the Raman spectrum, it was possible to discriminate different wines produced in the Piedmont area (North West Italy) in accordance with i) grape varieties, ii) production area and iii) ageing time. In order to create a consistent training set, more than 300 samples from tens of different producers were analyzed, and a chemometric treatment of raw spectra was applied. A discriminant analysis method was employed in the classification procedures, providing a classification capability (percentage of correct answers) of 90% for validation of grape analysis and geographical area provenance, and a classification capability of 84% for ageing time classification. The present methodology was applied successfully to raw materials without any preliminary treatment of the sample, providing a response in a very short time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In agri-food supply chains (ASCs), consumers pay for agri-food products produced by farmers. During this process, consumers emphasize the importance of agri-food safety while farmers expect to increase their profits. Due to the complexity and dynamics of ASCs, the effective traceability and management for agri-food products face huge challenges. However, most of the existing solutions cannot well meet the requirements of traceability and management in ASCs. To address these challenges, we first design a blockchain-based ASC framework to provide product traceability, which guarantees decentralized security for the agri-food tracing data in ASCs. Next, a Deep Reinforcement learning based Supply Chain Management (DR-SCM) method is proposed to make effective decisions on the production and storage of agri-food products for profit optimization. The extensive simulation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed blockchain-based framework and the DR-SCM method under different ASC environments. The results show that reliable product traceability is well guaranteed by using the proposed blockchain-based ASC framework. Moreover, the DR-SCM can achieve higher product profits than heuristic and Q-learning methods.

AB The variability in carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) of the main olive oil fatty acids, together with their relative contents, have been measured in 60 monovarietal olive oils, produced from plants grown in the same orchard and harvested at five ripening stages. The fatty acid content was mainly influenced by the cultivar, without significant changes during ripening. On the contrary, the fatty acid delta C-13 value varied from October to December reflecting physiological responses to environmental variations. ANOVA-Simultaneous Component Analysis (ASCA) was applied to explore the sample variability among factors and interactions. In particular harvest date resulted the main factor affecting our multivariate dataset and OA delta C-13 resulted the most discriminating parameter related to this factor. On the other side, LA relative content displayed the highest sensitivity to the range of cultivar variability, suggesting that this parameter may be used as a useful tool for studying inter-varietal differences in olive oils. The results find possible application in olive oil authentication and traceability studies.

AB For a rapid, specific and sensitive identification of cows', ewes' and goats' milk in mono-species Sicilian dairy products, species-specific duplex-PCR protocol was applied. DNA samples from blood and experimental cheeses of Sicilian autochthonous breeds were extracted to amplify the 12S rRNA (and part of 16S rRNA in case of Ovis aries) mitochondrial species-specific gene fragment. The use of species-specific primers for Bos taurus, Capra hircus and Ovis aries species, after electrophoresis on agarose gel, yielded fragments of 256 bp, 326 bp and 172 bp, respectively. Amplification by duplex-PCR of DNA pools from two species showed detection thresholds of 0.1% of "contaminant" DNA in each mixture. Finally, duplex-PCR assay was applied to experimental cheeses in order to detect the minimum threshold of DNA belonging to one species in cheese made with milk of two species. The results showed a sensitive threshold of 0.1% of ewes' milk in cows' and goats' cheeses, 0.1% of cows' milk in ewes' and goats' cheeses, and finally 0.1% of goats' milk in cows' and ewes' cheeses. The proposed assay represents a rapid and straightforward method of species traceability for the detections of adulteration in Sicilian mono-species dairy products.

AB Nowadays, consumer awareness of the impact of site of origin and method of production on the quality and safety of foods, and particularly of fresh produce, is driving the research towards developing various techniques to assist present certifications, traceability, and audit procedures. With regard to horticultural produce, consumer preferences have shifted to fruit and vegetables, which are healthy and ecologically produced, and toward processed foods having sustainable or social certifications and with sites of origin clearly reported on the label. Some recent studies demonstrate the potentiality of near infrared (NIR) technology (including hyperspectral imaging) for discriminating fresh and processed horticultural products based on their composition, quality attributes, and origin. These studies principally mention that each biological tissue possesses a fingerprint NIR spectrum, which consists of a unique and characteristic pattern of radiation, distinguishing a particular biological tissue from physically and/or chemically different samples. Particularly, recent studies discriminated apples, wine, wheat kernels, and derived flours based on their geographical origins. Spectral information allowed discrimination among growing methods (organic and conventional) for asparagus and strawberry fruits, and among harvest dates for fennels, table grapes, and artichokes. Moreover, information about freshness and storage days after minimal processing can be obtained. Recent literature and original results will be discussed. From our perspective, present results suggest that these techniques may have a potentiality to increase information about product history, but if and only if the variability captured by the classification models is vast in terms of diverse samples belonging to various cultivars, varieties, harvest times, cultural practices, geographical origins, storage conditions, and maturity stages, while being used as a complementary method to the conventional ones-either to make an initial screening of critical features, or to add to the amount of available information. Lacking the inclusion of these parameters could result in good classification results, but the reliability of the classification in this case would be dubious in terms of assessment of the factor contributing towards correct classification.

AB BACKGROUND Most studies focus on the geographically larger production areas in tea traceability. However, famous high-quality tea is often produced in a narrow range of origins, which makes traceability a challenge. In this study, Taiping Houkui (TPHK) green tea of narrow geographical origin was rapidly identified using Fourier-transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy. RESULTS First, spectral information of 114 TPHK samples from four production areas was acquired. Second, the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) was used to balance the sample data set, and three different spectral pre-processing methods were compared. Third, three feature variable selection algorithms were used to obtain the pre-processed spectral features. Finally, extreme learning machine (ELM) models based on the variables obtained from the selected features were established to trace the TPHK origin. The optimized ELM model achieves 95.35% classification accuracy in the test set. CONCLUSION The present study demonstrates that the optimized variable selection method in combination with NIR spectroscopy represents a suitable strategy for tea traceability in narrow regions.

AB Certified reference materials (CRMs) with high accuracy and traceability are essential tools for validation of analytical methods and calibration of equipment. They are widely used in various fields and have an important role in analytical science. In this study, tangeretin purity certified reference material was first developed in compliance with the principles of ISO guides. The investigation included preparation, characterization, homogeneity test, stability study and uncertainty estimation. In the characterization, mass balance method (MB) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were simultaneously utilized, which would make up for the deficiency of a single method and cross-check the determination results. The mass balance method involved measurement of main component, as well as moisture, volatile impurities and inorganic impurities. Homogeneity, together with short-term and long-term stability, was investigated and the uncertainty estimation was performed. The results showed that tangeretin CRM was sufficiently homogeneous and stable for 12 months at 4 degrees C. The certified value is 99.8%, and the expanded uncertainty is 0.1% (k = 2).

AB Food fraud associated with the intentional mislabelling of non-Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) is a concern for consumers. "Maca similar to de Alcobaca" (Alcobaca apple) is one of the oldest Portuguese PGI products, characteristic of the main apple-growing regions in the country, being of utmost importance to develop trace-ability and authenticity tools to depict the PGI certification status of these products. Pulp multielement signa-tures were able to discriminate with moderate accuracy (65.7 %) different Royal Gala clones, grown within the same cultivation area. Moreover, Variable Importance in Projection Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (VIP-PLS-DA) allowed the discrimination of the Royal Gala samples from different PGI producers with 70.0 % accuracy. Apple PGI cultivars were also discriminated accurately (82.0 %). Expanding the approach to non-PGI production areas, several cultivars could be distinguished, according to their provenance with high accuracy, namely Starking (100.0 % accuracy), Granny Smith (100.0 % accuracy), Fuji (100.0 % accuracy), Royal Gala (86.7 % accuracy) and Reineta (90.3 % accuracy). The PGI fruit's microelement nutritional traits highlighted their higher nutritional value, an important trait for food fraud reduction, informing the consumer of the product authenticity, and providing insights on the nutritional value of these high-value market products.

AB BACKGROUNDThe aim of this paper is to provide a methodological approach to evaluate the nutritional sustainability of typical agro-food products, representing Mediterranean eating habits and included in the Mediterranean food pyramid.
   RESULTSFor each group of foods, suitable and easily measurable indicators were identified. Two macro-indicators were used to assess the nutritional sustainability of each product. The first macro-indicator, called business distinctiveness', takes into account the application of different regulations and standards regarding quality, safety and traceability as well as the origin of raw materials. The second macro-indicator, called nutritional quality', assesses product nutritional quality taking into account the contents of key compounds including micronutrients and bioactive phytochemicals. For each indicator a 0-10 scoring system was set up, with scores from 0 (unsustainable) to 10 (very sustainable), with 5 as a sustainability benchmark value. The benchmark value is the value from which a product can be considered sustainable. A simple formula was developed to produce a sustainability index.
   CONCLUSIONThe proposed sustainability index could be considered a useful tool to describe both the qualitative and quantitative value of micronutrients and bioactive phytochemical present in foodstuffs. This methodological approach can also be applied beyond the Mediterranean, to food products in other world regions. (c) 2018 Society of Chemical Industry

AB In order to guarantee food integrity, testing methods should also include the tools needed to verify the geographical origin described on the label. In the particular case of virgin olive oil (VOO), regulatory bodies have yet to establish a standard for geographical identification. This manuscript describes a procedure based on Raman spectroscopy to identify the provenance of these oils based on a classification criterion (European vs non-European VOOs). The sample collection is considered a relevant step in which multiple factors are taken into account (cultivar distribution, complexity of production in each location, new agricultural practices, and new/old cultivars). A total of 78 virgin olive oils collected around the world allow checking the classification accuracy of the model for identifying sample origin. The PLS-model built around the Raman spectroscopic data is validated with a blind set of samples, and the results are evaluated in terms of false negative and false positive quality parameters. This study provides an analytical application to detect mislabeling and fraudulent practices related to the geographical provenance of virgin olive oils declared on the labels. Practical Applications: The results of this study provide a robust mathematical model to assess the origin of virgin olive oils (EU vs non-EU) based on spectroscopic data. Nowadays, the extensive knowledge of olive oil chemical composition has proven that this composition varies according to pedoclimatic conditions, while non-targeted methods can be proposed in geographical traceability for their ability to analyze the chemical profile of samples. However, it was deemed necessary to conduct a study through a collaborative work initiative. Thus, this study provides a strict evaluation of Raman spectroscopy through a defined strategy for evaluating non-targeted methods for geographical identification.

AB Tarhana is a popular Turkish fermented wheat-yogurt mixture for soup making. This traditional food is widely consumed in Turkey. In the last decades, tarhana has been produced commercially in factory. Ingredients of tarhana both homemade and fabricated are display variations. Quality control of tarhana is becoming a problem. The IR spectra of 12 commercial (COM) or home-made (HM) samples were investigated. The T% values were constantly inferior in the HM (-15%) sign of a richer content. Along the spectra from 4000 to 400 cm-1 the F fisher's test of single wavelength differentiated maximally the two types at 402 cm-1(P=0.23), but a wavelength selection process clusterized 6 bands (2476, 1596, 1364, 608, 596, 402 cm-1). A multiple regression was developed on the six bands in a discriminative equation provided by a R2 0.92 (R2adj 0.83). After full cross-validation the R2 values descended to 0.65, but only 1 sample of COM type was missed as HM. Some hypothesis concerned the implicated bands in regards to a different vitamin B3 (Niacine) contents. IR spectroscopy is a useful tool to identify a sample due to its unique results. FTIR Spectra results show that vibrational frequencies can be specific data to confirm the quality and traceability of tarhana.

AB Leptospirosis is a major zoonosis with worldwide distribution. Conventional serological typing is arduous and time consuming. Genotyping is increasingly applied for the typing and identification of leptospires and contributes to genetic and virulence divergence and molecular epidemiological characteristics such as host versus leptospires population interactions and dynamics. Presently, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) is the most robust approach. In this chapter, we describe the practical steps of two major multilocus sequence typing methods for leptospires. The first method (denoted as the 6 L scheme) is based on genotyping by phylogeny using concatenated sequences derived from six loci, including genes that encode outer membrane proteins and rrs and can be used for typing pathogenic species and strains of intermediate species. The second method (referred to as the 7 L scheme) uses seven loci on housekeeping genes and allows the analysis of seven major Leptospira pathogenic species. The 7 L scheme is web based and includes the option to analyze sequence types (STs).

AB Before being put out onto the market many fish species sold around the world need to be processed, which may result in the subsequent removal of characteristics used for their classification (head, fins, internal organs). The biochemical characterization of fish species could be achieved using proteins or DNA sequences as species-specific markers. However, since different fish products undergo different processes, the method of analysis has to be chosen according to the modifications undergone by fish constituents during processing.
   As DNA molecules are more resistant than proteins to various processes (including thermal treatment), DNA analysis appears to be a promising method for fish species identification. For the species identification of the Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio) among 15 different freshwater fish species a specific pre-designed molecular - genetic marker of Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio) was used, which comes from the mtDNA control D - loop area. Next we analyzed the presence of mtDNA in DNA isolates of the 15 kinds of freshwater fish and compared them with the Common Carp markers by using the following two PCR identification methods. The isolates were diluted to 10 % concentration, using the TaqMan Real-Time PCR method and the SYBR (R) Green Real-Time PCR method.
   The results of using the optimized the SYBR (R) Green Real-Time PCR method for species identification of the Common Carp (C. carpio) pointed to its suitability. We were able to create an analysis of the monitored standard curve which represented the PCR positive control (C. carpio), containing the characteristic melting peak (up to the melting point 80.72 degrees C). A single peak indicated a single product (C. carpio) which can be verified upon characterization of the PCR product by agarose gel electrophoresis.
   The TaqMan Real-Time PCR method with a TaqMan probe is a very sensitive and reliable method of authentication used on food of animal origin. The suitability of this method, which we used for species identification of the Common Carp (C. carpio), was confirmed. Thanks to using this method, already in the 17th cycle of the PCR amplification procedure, the presence of the Common Carp gene (C. carpio) was detected in the positive control and not detected in the rest of the fish samples.

AB Quality control and traceability of Argan oil requires precise chemical characterization considering different provenances. The fatty acid profile is an essential parameter that certifies the quality and purity of Argan oil. In addition, stable isotopes were recently shown to be accurate as an indicator for geographical origin. In this study, fatty acid composition by gas chromatography (GC) and stable isotope ratio by isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) were investigated for classifying Argan oil according to its geographical origin. Forty-one Argan oil samples, belonging to six geographical origins of Moroccan natural Argan population (Safi, Essaouira, Agadir Ida Outanane, Taroudant, Tiznit and Sidi Ifni) were collected and extracted under the same conditions. The results show that the isotope delta C-13, palmitic acid (C16:0), linoleic acid (C18:2) and unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) were strongly influenced by ecological parameters. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was performed to discriminate the six studied provenances. Discriminant models predicted the origin of Argan oil with 92.70% success. Samples from Safi, Essaouira and Agadir Ida Outanane presented the highest classification rate (100%). In contrast, the lowest rate was reported for samples from Tiznit (85.70%). The findings obtained for fatty acids and isotope combination might be considered as an accurate tool for determining the geographical origins of Argan oil. Moreover, they can potentially be used as specific markers for oils labeled with Protected Geographical Indication (PGI).

ID CATTLE MOVEMENTS; BRITAIN
AB Background Animal movement is considered the most significant factor in the transmission of infectious diseases in livestock. A better understanding of its effects would help provide a more reliable estimation of the disease spread and help develop effective control measures. If the movement pattern is heterogeneous, its characteristics should be considered in epidemiological analyses, such as when using simulation models to obtain reliable outputs. In Japan, following the bovine spongiform encephalopathy epidemic, a traceability system for cattle was established in 2003, and the registration of all cattle movements in the national database began. This study is the first to analyze cattle movements in Japan. We examined regional and seasonal heterogeneity in dairy cow movements, which accounted for most Japanese breeding cattle. Results In the 14 years from April 2005 to March 2018, 4,577,709 between-farm movements of dairy cows were recorded, and the number of movements was counted by month and age for both inter- and intra-regional movements. As a result, two characteristic round-trip movements were observed: one was non-seasonal and inter-regional movements related to cattle-breeding ranches in Hokkaido (the northern region of Japan), which consists of the movement of cows around ages 6 to 8 and 21 to 23 months old. In addition, the seasonal movement of heifers for summer grazing within Hokkaido occurred in May and October at the peak ages of 13 to 14 and 19 to 20 months old, respectively. The observed heterogeneity seemed to reflect the suitability of raising the Holstein breed in Hokkaido and the shortage of supply of replacement heifers and available farming areas outside Hokkaido. Conclusions Understanding the patterns of dairy cow movements will help develop reliable infectious disease models and be beneficial for developing effective control measures against these diseases.

AB Molecular markers are a helpful tool for species detection of meat origin, in order to determine with accuracy the possible fraud of animal-based food products. In this study, blood, milk and cheese samples were taken from the Romanian "Baltata" bovine species. In the blood extraction stage, the commercial Wizard Genomic DNA Extraction Kit was used, and for the milk and cheese extraction, the SureFood (R) PREP Advanced kit was used. Target DNA amplification in all the three matrices was performed with the StockMarks for Cattle kit. It was found that the analyzed loci had the size of the fragments within the reference range given by the kit used, which concludes that the blood, milk and the cheese have the same origin, from the same animal of the bovine species. Therefore, through the genotyping technique, traceability of food products can be achieved and the species of origin can be identified.

AB There is an increasing trend upon adding a detailed description of the origin of seafood products driven by a general interest in the implementation of sustainable fishery management plans for the conservation of marine ecosystems. North Atlantic albacore ("Bonito del Norte con Eusko Label") and Bay of Biscay anchovy ("Anchoa Cantabrico") are two commercially important fish populations with high economical value and vulnerable to commercial fraud. This fact, together with the overexploited situation of these two populations, makes it necessary to develop a tool to identify individual origin and to detect Commercial fraud. In the present study, we have developed and validated a traceability tool consisting, of reduced panels of gene-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) suitable for assigning individuals of two species to their origin with unprecedented accuracy levels. Only 48 SNPs are necessary to assign 81.1% albacore and 93.4% anchovy individuals with 100% accuracy to their geographic origin. The total accuracy of the results demonstrates how gene-associated SNPs can revolutionize food traceability. Gene-associated SNP panels are not of mere commercial interest, but they also can result in a positive impact on sustainability of marine ecosystems through conservation of fish populations through establishing more effective and sustainable fishery management framework and contributing to the prevention of falsified labeling.

AB Agricultural pruning biomass is one of the important resources in Europe for generating renewable energy. However, utilization of the agricultural residues requires development of efficient and effective logistics systems. The objective of this study was to develop smart logistics system (SLS) appropriate for the management of the pruning biomass supply chain. The paper describes the users' requirement of SLS, defines the technical and functional requirements and specifications for the development of SLS, and determines relevant information/data to be documented and managed by the SLS. This SLS has four major components: (a) Smart box, a sensor unit that enables measurement of data such as relative humidity, temperature, geographic positions; (b) On-board control unit, a unit that performs route planning and monitors the recordings by the smart box; (c) Information platform, a centralized platform for data storing and sharing, and management of pruning supply chain and traceability; and (d) Central control unit, an interface linking the Information platform and On-board control unit that serves as a point of administration for the whole pruning biomass supply chain from harvesting to end user. The SLS enables the improvement of performance of pruning biomass supply chain management and product traceability leading to a reduction of product loss, increased coordination of resources utilisation and quality of solid biofuel supply, increased pruning marketing opportunity, and reduction of logistics cost. This SLS was designed for pruning biomass, but could also be adapted for any type of biomass-to-energy initiatives.

ID FUTURE; AGRICULTURE; EFFICIENCY; MODEL
AB The harvest process for specialty crops is generally one of intensive activity because many people are required for harvest and packing, and the harvest window is brief due to the high perishability of the produce. Herein we present a cloud-based Harvest Management Information System (HMIS) that combines a novel real-time Portable Labor Monitoring System (PLMS) with a cloud-based harvest management software. The PLMS comprised of three key elements (1) a self-leveling scale, (2) electronic control box, and (3) a frame that supports all hardware. The electronic control box includes: (i) a RFID reader, (ii) a LCD display, (iii) a thermal printer, (iv) a GPS module, and (v) a communication system. RFID tags, containing unique ID numbers, embedded within rubber wrist bands, are worn by pickers. This system can read a picker's ID (RFID bracelet), measure the weight of fruit, and record the time and location (optional) of every, fruit 'transaction' (i.e., every time a picker brings a bucket of fruit to the collection bin). The collected data can be transmitted wirelessly to the server in real-time. The cloud-based software receives and processes the PLMS data on labor activities, visualizes the collected data, and can extract the data necessary for management information and automated filling of documents (e.g. payroll, yield maps). The HMIS is unique in its ability to: (1) accurately credit pickers for the fruit they have harvested in the field without impeding or altering the harvest process, (2) streamline data entry to payroll, (3) provide real-time tracking of harvest, yield mapping, and traceability, and, (4) generate precise and reliable harvest efficiency data. This integrated system was evaluated in sweet cherry, blueberry and apple orchards in Washington, USA. The weight of harvested fruit, time and location of every fruit drop were calculated accurately; all the data were transmitted wirelessly to the server and no errors were recorded.

AB The modern trends in the field of food quality management place emphasis on ensuring the traceability and systemic control of the parameters of the life cycle of products. ISO 9000 international standards recommend a process approach for these purposes. Since the standards do not give direct recommendations on the procedure for estimating the effectiveness of the quality management system (QMS), the development of approaches is an extremely urgent task for developers and has a wide application value. The given paper proposes a mathematical model for the complex estimation of the effectiveness of the QMS of a food enterprise. At the first stage, IDEF0 functional modeling methods were used to identify the processes of the life cycle of food products. Then, using the qualimetric approach, 27 unique indices were generated and coefficients were determined for each of them using Fishburn's weight coefficients. To derive a mathematical model for the complex estimation of the effectiveness of QMS processes of a food enterprise, all data were summarized from four levels of the hierarchy. The proposed mathematical model includes the quantitative and qualitative estimation of enterprise processes. The estimation indicators form a treelike hierarchy in which the factors of each sublevel have their own weight coefficients and are in preference or indifference relation to each other. The application of a mathematical model for the complex estimation of the effectiveness of QMS of a food or processing enterprise allows full compliance with the requirements of international standards, but does not require significant financial costs for implementation.

AB To date, medicinal plants form the backbone of primary healthcare for 70-95% of the population of the developing world. Therefore, medicinal plants help in alleviating human suffering and are widely used for traditional remedies, pharmaceutical materials, and trade. Cancer patients numbers are increasing worldwide, ranking this disease as the second disease cause of mortality for both sexes. Traditionally, medicinal plants have been used in the fight against cancer, then it is considered as the basis for medicines discovery, and nowadays more than 70% of anticancer drugs have a natural source. The biotechnological tools are necessary to select, multiply, improve, and analyze medicinal plants. This chapter highlights the history of using the medicinal plants indigenously worldwide, i.e., anticancer reservoirs and also answers to many questions, such as: Why the importance of using medicinal plants is increasing recently? What are the benefits of applying the biotechnology in medicinal plants? It then describes the new biotech technique of the traceability by using PCR-DGGE to determine the geographical origin of medicinal plants (a case study of Physalis fruits from four different countries) by analyzing the DNA fragments of microorganisms (yeasts) on plants. This method is based on the assumption that the microbial communities of environmental samples are unique to a geographic area.

AB The use of pasture grazing systems offers a means to improve feed self-sufficiency and reduce labor for dairy farmers. Consumers also are interested in milk and dairy products obtained from cows on pasture-based diets. However, little is known about the difference between milk obtained from grazing cows and general milk obtained from cows on an indoor feeding system. There is almost no information about the flavor constituents, whereas many studies have been conducted on such characteristics as the fatty acid composition, conjugated linoleic acids, and carotenoids of milk from grazing cows. In this review, we describe studies that have characterized the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in milk and our investigations on the effects of pasture intake on VOCs in milk. The VOC, 1-phytene has been used to characterize milk from grazing cows as there is a strong positive correlation between pasture intake and the concentration of 1-phytene in milk. In addition, milk from cows in a grazing system can be distinguished from that of animals in an indoor feeding system using the levels of 1-phytene, gamma-dodecalactone, 2-phytene, neophytadiene, and delta-dodecalactone.

AB The bacterial community of Suranaree University of Technology (SUT) tilapia was studied with the aim to develop a model for traceable biological markers. Five fish per time were collected from SUT farm and other sources. Total viable counts (TVC) of bacteria from SUT farm were quite similar in all seasons. Seventy three percent of the bacteria were Gram-negative. Total DNA extracted from the fish gills and intestines were used as template to amplify bacterial 16S rDNA V3 region using GC clamp primer to identify specific bacteria of fish origin by PCR-DGGE technique. The results showed 3 DNA bands on DGGE gel that were specific to only bacterial DNA of SUT tilapia when compared to the other sources. The 3 DNA bands were sequenced and identified as uncultured bacteria of different species. Primers were designed from the 3 specific sequences and used to amplify DNA samples from four sources and some pure cultured bacteria. The results indicated that, only one primer pair can amplify DNA samples from SUT farm but not other samples. This primer pair can be used to identify and trace samples from SUT farm. This method can be used as a model to develop bacterial primer specific location for other food products. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Mediterranean diet is promoted as one of the healthiest and closely linked to socioecological practices, knowledge and traditions, promoting sustainable food production, and linking geographical origin with food quality and ecosystem services. Consumer adherence to this dietary pattern drives increased consumption of authentic "premium" foods, such as Iberian pig meat and dry-cured ham from Portugal and Spain, argan oil from Morocco, "Djebel" lamb from Tunisia and truffles from Italy and Slovenia, i.e., food products that respond to current ethical, environmental and socially sustainable demands. Geographical indication and appellation of origin can increase traditional food products competitiveness, but the high-value recognition of these products can also lead to economically motivated product adulteration. It is therefore imperative to protect the high added value of these unique food products by ensuring their quality, authenticity, provenance and sustainable production systems. In this review, we provide a critical evaluation of the analytical methods that are currently used for the determination of provenance and authenticity of these Mediterranean products as well as possible strategies for improving the throughput and affordability of the methods discussed.

TI Analysis of animal monitoring technologies in Germany from an innovation

ID AGRICULTURE
AB In order to address societal demands (e.g., animal welfare, traceability, environmental aspects), animal monitoring (AM) technologies provide much potential for innovation in animal production. AM means the real time and on-going automatic monitoring by 'smart' sensors of physiological, growth and behaviour parameters of individual farming animals, integrated in various areas (e.g., animal milking, feeding, breeding, health). The literature on AM mainly focusses on technologies and their application. The available information about innovation processes in AM is still very fragmentary and not comprehensive. The present article analyses the generation, development and use of AM technologies in Germany from a dynamic innovation system perspective. The analytical framework of the article is based on the sectoral innovation system approach. Qualitative interviews, an expert workshop, and a Delphi survey were conducted to explore the roles and interactions of heterogeneous actors in innovation processes and the interlocking between innovation stages. On the basis of identified fostering and inhibiting factors, opportunities for systemic interventions are suggested to further innovations in AM and in the German animal production sector and in other countries. These interventions consider, on the one hand, recommendations to support AM technologies and their broader implementation Chard skill interventions') and, on the other hand, interventions that are suitable to stimulate innovations in animal production without specific focus on a single technological regime or innovation area ('soft skill interventions'). The 'hard skill interventions' refer to the need for improvements concerning system compatibility and data exchange; the special need for financial support of extensive validation of AM technologies and clear communication of benefits or constraints to farmers. 'Soft skill interventions' are related to innovation capacity building of actors in order to coordinate co-development processes and to improve communication: Finding of a common understanding of the innovation system and common language among actors; early involvement of all actors and the reflection of actors' roles; resource-based fostering of network management Finally, innovation policies should be capable to gather and react appropriately to these requirements. Generally, the study contributes to a better understanding of the complexity of innovation activities in AM and their embedding in the innovation system of animal production. The opportunities for systemic intervention can be used by the sector's actors to enhance the innovativeness of the German sector and to make better use of AM potentials to address the global challenges and societal demands.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the genetic diversity of the Garfagnina (GRF) goat, a breed that currently risks extinction. For this purpose, 48 goats were genotyped with the Illumina CaprineSNP50 BeadChip and analyzed together with 214 goats belonging to 9 other Italian breeds (similar to 25 goats/breed), whose genotypes were available from the AdaptMap project [Argentata (ARG), Bionda dell'Adamello (BIO), Ciociara Grigia (CCG), Di Teramo (DIT), Garganica (GAR), Girgentana (GGT), Orobica (ORO), Valdostana (VAL) and Valpassiria (VSS)]. Comparative analyses were conducted on i) runs of homozygosity (ROH), ii) admixture ancestries and iii) the accuracy of breed traceability via discriminant analysis on principal components (DAPC) based on cross-validation. ROH analyses was used to assess the genetic diversity of GRF, while admixture and DAPC to evaluate its relationship to the other breeds. For GRF, common ROH (more than 45% in GRF samples) was detected on CHR 12 at, roughly 50.25-50.94Mbp (ARS1 assembly), which spans the CENPJ (centromere protein) and IL17D (interleukin 17D) genes. The same area of common ROH was also present in DIT, while a broader region (similar to 49.25-51.94Mbp) was shared among the ARG, CCG, and GGT. Admixture analysis revealed a small region of common ancestry from GRF shared by BIO, VSS, ARG and CCG breeds. The DAPC model yielded 100% assignment success for GRF. Overall, our results support the identification of GRF as a distinct native Italian goat breed. This work can contribute to planning conservation programmes to save GRF from extinction and will improve the understanding of the socio-agro-economic factors related with the farming of GRF.

AB Foods based on Olea europaea are of substantial importance for Mediterranean people. The association between olive products with great civilizations emphasizes the role that played the olive tree products and especially the olive oil. This generated the need for authentication, quality control and traceability of olive products. The physicochemical and sensory analysis methods, both classical (discrimination, ordination, classification) and novel (artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, expert systems, decision trees, support vector machines) supplemented with molecular marker techniques (SSR, AFLP, RAPD), generated the need for effective multivariate analytical methods. These mathematically complex methods are greatly needed in the detection of adulterations of oil products and particularly for olive oil. The lack of mathematical symbolism and jargon is believed to make the text attractive to all potential workers in the field and help them improve the already low level of adulterations and augment the quality control databases for Mediterranean olive products.

ID VEHICLE-ROUTING PROBLEM; TRANSPORT
AB The milk transformation process, in the last thirty years, moved from on-farm to centralised cheese factories, affecting the management of transport logistics. In Sardinia, the presence of about 12,000 dairy sheep farms, located in rural areas with poor condition of road network, makes collecting milk a significant impact on profit, affecting the costs of milk transportation. Moreover, dairy sheep farming is characterized by seasonal production, this means that the amount of milk that is produced by each farm differs significantly over the year. The objective of this work was to develop a decision support tool that, while optimising milk collection routes, reduced the costs of milk transport, thus improving the density of collection. The tool developed ad hoc in this study used GPS map location and milk volumes of farms to calculate the cost per litre of milk for the regular routing, and to recalculate the same cost for the optimised collecting route. Results showed that this tool improved the efficiency of milk collection, reducing the number of routes and the driving distances. Furthermore, optimising the density of collection, the new routes improved the environmental impact and the transportation costs that are associated with logistic and traceability of raw sheep milk.

AB Markus, S. B., Aalhus, J. L., Janz, J. A. M. and Larsen, I. L. 2011. A survey comparing meat quality attributes of beef from credence attribute-based production systems. Can. J. Anim. Sci. 91: 283-294. Two branded beef programs based on producer-defined production systems differentiated by intangible credence attributes (Organic and Natural) were compared with Commodity beef to determine meat quality and assess consumer acceptability. In each of four slaughter seasons (winter, spring, summer and fall) longissimus lumborum muscle samples were collected from two industry slaughter plants; Organic n=30, 30, 27 and 31; Natural n = 30, 27, 29 and 25; Commodity 1 n = 12 and 18 for spring and summer, respectively; Commodity 2 a = 14 and 12 for spring and fall, respectively. Samples were vacuum packaged and aged for 16 +/- 2 d at 2 degrees C. Seasonal effects (P < 0.01) were evident for mean shear force, composition, drip loss, colour and pH. While all mean shear values were classified as being tender (< 5.6 kg), a smaller proportion of steaks were classified as tender in the Organic beef compared with the Natural and Commodity beef (55.9 vs. 70.3 and 78.6%; P < 0.01), indicating that even after industry normal ageing times there was higher tenderness variability in the Organic beef. Fat content (SEM = 0.23; P < 0.01) was lowest for the Organic line (3.98%) with Natural (5.34%) and Commodity being intermediate (5.73%). Some statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) in mean scores for aroma, juiciness, flavour, tenderness and overall acceptability of cooked beef steaks were observed amongst the three production systems when samples were not matched on the basis of intramuscular fat (IMF). Clearly there are measureable differences in quality between "credence" based production systems and commodity beef with an overall better quality in Commodity beef. However, if the consumer is willing to pay for credence-based attributes then there is an opportunity for these production systems to improve the quality of their product, specifically in respect to age at slaughter and content of IMF.

AB In order to evaluate the genetic diversity and discrimination among five Korean native chicken lines, a total of 86 individuals were genotyped using 150 microsatellite (MS) markers, and 15 highly polymorphic MS markers were selected. Based on the highest value of the number of alleles, the expected heterozygosity (He) and polymorphic information content (PIC) for the selected markers ranged from 6 to 12, 0.466 to 0.852, 0.709 to 0.882 and 0.648 to 0.865, respectively. Using these markers, the calculated genetic distance (Fst), the heterozygote deficit among chicken lines (Fit) and the heterozygote deficit within chicken line (Fis) values ranged from 0.0309 to 0.2473, 0.0013 to 0.4513 and -0.1002 to 0.271, respectively. The expected probability of identity values in random individuals (PI), random half-sib (PIhalf-sibs) and random sibs (PIsibs) were estimated at 7.98x10(-29), 2.88x10(-20) and 1.25x10(-08), respectively, indicating that these markers can be used for traceability systems in Korean native chickens. The unrooted phylogenetic neighbor-joining (NJ) tree was constructed using 15 MS markers that clearly differentiated among the five native chicken lines. Also, the structure was estimated by the individual clustering with the K value of 5. The selected 15 MS markers were found to be useful for the conservation, breeding plan, and traceability system in Korean native chickens.

AB Paris Polyphylla Smith var. yunnanensis (Franch.) Hand.-Mazz has multiple therapeutic properties and the origins may affect clinical efficacy. Tracing the geographical origin is important to the authentication and quality assessment of this species. 177 wild samples collected from central, southeast and northwest Yunnan Province, China, were analyzed by single analytical method and data fusion strategies (low- and mid-levels) using Fourier transform mid-infrared (FT-MIR) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopies combined with chemometrics (partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) and support vector machines grid search (SVM-GS)), for categorizing samples from different geographic origins. According to the results, mid-level data fusion strategy presented a better generalization performance and accuracy rates based on latent variables selected by PLS-DA than single analytical method and low-level data fusion strategy. Accuracy rates were almost 100% when both of the PLS-DA and SVM-GS were employed for classifying samples picked from southeast and northwest districts based on mid-level dataset. For samples collected from central of Yunnan where was divided into seven categories in this paper, the accuracy rates of training set and test set of PLS-DA and SVM-GS were preferable (>87%). Based on the mid-level data set, both of the classification results of PLS-DA and SVM-GS presented satisfying accuracy for 177 samples. Additionally, as small as possible parameters showed in mid-level data set, it suggested that this method was robust and generalized. Therefore, the comprehensive method was established for the origin traceability of wild P. Polyphylla Smith var. yunnanensis, which is meaningful for the quality control of herbal medicines.

AB The muscles derived from livestock are highly perishable. Rapid and nondestructive methods are essential for quality assurance of such products. Potential nondestructive methods, which can supplement or replace many of traditional time consuming destructive methods, include colour and computer image analysis, NIR spectroscopy, NMRI, electronic nose, ultrasound, X-ray imaging and biosensors. These methods are briefly described and the research work involving them for products derived from livestock is reviewed. These methods will be helpful in rapid screening of large number of samples, monitoring distribution networks, quick product recall and enhance traceability in the value chain of livestock products. With new developments in the areas of basic science related to these methods, colour, image processing, NIR spectroscopy, biosensors and ultrasonic analysis are expected to be widespread and cost effective for large scale meat quality evaluation in near future.

AB Tracing movements could assist the implementation of bio-containment measures during a disease outbreak. To evaluate the potential for implementing a tracing system for a poultry supply chain in northern Vietnam, a four-month longitudinal study was conducted to identify marketing practices associated with poultry traceability. Poultry sold in batches were traced between farms and markets, and their traceability was assessed upon market arrival. A total of 315 batches were released from the farms; 37% arrived at a market, from which 57.3% were 'traceable'. The results of the multivariable analysis showed that traceability was associated with farms operating through no more than two traders (Odds ratio [OR] = 5.97, 95% CI 1.15-30.92) and batches brought to the market on the day of purchase (OR = 4.05, 95% CI 1.23-13.27). No specific incentives were provided to farmers or traders. Results suggest that there is potential for implementing a poultry traceability scheme, although the tracing methodology should be refined.

AB BACKGROUND Non-volatile compounds play a key role in the quality and price of Keemun black tea (KBT). The non-volatile compounds in KBT samples from different producing areas normally vary greatly. The development of rapid methods for tracing the geographical origin of KBT is useful. In this study, we develop models for the discrimination of KBT's geographical origin based on non-volatile compounds. RESULTS Seventy-two KBT samples were collected from five towns in Anhui province to determine 13 KBT compounds by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Analysis of variance showed that the content of 13 compounds in KBT indicated significant differences (P < 0.05) among five towns. Three multivariate statistical models including principal component analysis (PCA), soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were built to discriminate origin. Principal component analysis effectively extracted three principal components, namely theaflavins, galloylated catechins, and simple catechins. The high sensitivity (64.5%-99.2%) was achieved of SIMCA model. To establish the discriminant functions, six variables (gallic acid, (+)-catechin, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate, theaflavin-3-gallate, theaflavin-3,3 '-di-gallate, and total theaflavins) were chosen from 13 variables, and LDA was applied. This gave a satisfactory overall correct classification rate (94.4%) and cross-validation rate (88.9%) for KBT samples. CONCLUSION The results showed that HPLC analysis together with chemometrics is a reliable approach for tracing KBT and guaranteeing its authenticity. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

TI VALDUVIS: An innovative approach to assess the sustainability of fishing
   activities
SO FISHERIES RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Indicators; Integrated sustainability assessment; Electronic logbook;
   Monitoring tool; Stakeholder participation
AB The Belgian fishing sector is under pressure to demonstrate the sustainability of its fishing methods. First, the beam trawl (which accounts for 80% of the landings) is contested due to its low selectivity and significant disturbance of the sea bed. Second, the Belgian retail market has committed to sourcing sustainable seafood. However, converting to sustainable methods is costly and may not be feasible for the majority of fishers who have suffered economic losses in the wake of the 2008 fuel crisis. Instead of a full-scale transition to sustainable fishing, fishers have developed modifications to the beam trawl that reduce environmental impact and save fuel. We propose an indicator-based sustainability assessment tool (VALDUVIS) that recognizes these efforts and offers incentives for fishers to adopt more sustainable fishing practices. In this article, we describe the development of the tool and its potential applications. Integrated Sustainability Assessment (ISA) was used as a framework to develop the tool and to initiate the transition towards sustainability in the Belgian fishery. VALDUVIS offers a promising new method to assess sustainability in fisheries. The approach is innovative in several ways. First, indicator scores are calculated using official data flows (e.g., the electronic logbook), which enhances traceability and provides the possibility of communicating sustainability data soon after landing the fish. Second, indicators are scored on a fine scale (e.g., per fishing trip). Third, stakeholder participation was essential in the development of the tool. This enhanced the support of the wider fishing sector and assured the relevance of the indicators and the users' understanding of the tool. Fourth, the delivered tool is multi-purpose and can be easily adapted to the needs of a range of end users (wholesalers, retailers, authorities, researchers, etc.). The VALDUVIS tool offers a cost-effective alternative to known certification schemes that could be applied to any type of fishery. The Belgian fishing sector considers VALDUVIS to be suitable for monitoring the progress towards sustainability as well as for providing incentives for fishers to adopt better practices.

AB Phenolic compounds are highly valuable food components due to their potential utilisation as natural bioactive and antioxidant molecules for the food, cosmetic, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries. For this purpose, the development and optimisation of efficient extraction methods is crucial to obtain phenolic-rich extracts and, for some applications, free of interfering compounds. It should be accompanied with robust analytical tools that enable the standardisation of phenolic-rich extracts for industrial applications. New methodologies based on both novel extraction and/or analysis are also implemented to characterise and elucidate novel chemical structures and to face safety, pharmacology, and toxicity issues related to phenolic compounds at the molecular level. Moreover, in combination with multivariate analysis, the extraction and analysis of phenolic compounds offer tools for plant chemotyping, food traceability and marker selection in omics studies. Therefore, this study reviews extraction techniques applied to recover phenolic compounds from foods and agri-food by-products, including liquid-liquid extraction, solid-liquid extraction assisted by intensification technologies, solid-phase extraction, and combined methods. It also provides an overview of the characterisation techniques, including UV-Vis, infra-red, nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry and others used in minor applications such as Raman spectroscopy and ion mobility spectrometry, coupled or not to chromatography. Overall, a wide range of methodologies are now available, which can be applied individually and combined to provide complementary results in the roadmap around the study of phenolic compounds.

AB The paper presents a report on the performance evaluation of a newly developed smart logistics system (SLS). Field tests were conducted in Spain, Germany, and Sweden. The evaluation focused on the performance of a smart box tool (used to capture information during biomass transport) and a web-based information platform (used to monitor the flow of agricultural pruning from farms to end users and associated information flow). The tests were performed following a product usability testing approach, considering both qualitative and quantitative parameters. The detailed performance evaluation included the following: systematic analysis of 41 recordable parameters (stored in a spreadsheet database), analysis of feedback and problems encountered during the tests, and overall quality analysis applying the product quality model adapted from ISO/IEC FDIS 9126-1 standard. The data recording and storage and the capability to support product traceability and supply chain management were found to be very satisfactory, while assembly of smart box components (mainly the associated cables), data transferring intervals, and manageability could be improved. From the data retrieved during test activities, in more than 95% of the parameters within 41 columns, the expected values were displayed correctly. Some errors were observed, which might have been caused mainly by barriers that could hinder proper data recording and transfer from the smart box to the central database. These problems can be counteracted and the performance of the SLS can be improved so that it can be upgraded to be a marketable tool that can promote sustainable biomass-to-energy value chains.

AB This study aimed to develop a tool to validate multivariety breed egg quality classification depending on quality-related internal and external traits using a discriminant canonical analysis approach. A flock of 60 Utrerana hens (Franciscan, White, Black, and Partridge) and a control group of 10 Leghorn hens were placed in individual cages to follow the traceability of the eggs and perform an individual internal and external quality assessment. Egg groups were determined depending on their commercial size (S, M, L, and XL), laying hen breed, and variety. Egg weight, major diameter, minor diameter, shell b*, albumen height, and the presence or absence of visual defects in yolk and/or albumen showed multicollinearity problems (variance inflation factor (VIF) > 5) and were discarded. Albumen weight, eggshell weight, and yolk weight were the most responsible traits for the differences among egg quality categories (Wilks' lambda: 0.335, 0.539, and 0.566 for albumen weight, eggshell weight, and yolk weight, respectively). The combination of traits in the first two dimensions explained 55.02% and 20.62% variability among groups, respectively. Shared properties between Partridge and Franciscan varieties may stem from their eggs presenting heavier yolks and slightly lower weights, while White Utrerana and Leghorn hens' similarities may be ascribed to hybridization reminiscences.

AB The botanical origin of honey is subjected to severe controls by Food Control Institutions, both for health protection and for frauds prevention. The complexity of honey makes it very difficult to verify the botanical origin. Among the available validated methods, sensory analysis and melissopalynology are the most widely employed. These methods require a long time and deep consolidated expertise. To shorten analysis time while simplifying the analytical procedure, head-space flash gas chromatography was applied in the present study. Chromatographic peak areas were processed by chemometrics (in particular principal components analysis and linear discriminant analysis). Three hundred and thirty-nine honey samples from twelve categories of unifloral honey were analyzed: acacia, citrus, chestnut, thistle, tree heath, eucalyptus, sunflower, rhododendron, lime, French honeysuckle, fir honeydew, and wood honeydew. Each sample was a priori classified by sensory analysis. The multivariate models were validated by cross validation and test-set validation, with predictive abilities always higher than 80%: good results were obtained both in calibration and in prediction mode, showing a good agreement between this new approach and the traditional one for the determination of the botanical origin of honey.

AB Our hypothesis was that carotenoids in bovine subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) together with colour and reflectance spectra could be used to differentiate between beef production systems based on grass, concentrates or combinations thereof. SAT was sampled from the carcasses of heifers fed pasture (P), a barley-based concentrate (C), silage followed by pasture (Sip) or silage followed by pasture with concentrate (SiPC). beta-carotene in the SAT from the C group (0.09 mu g g(-1)) was lower (P<0.05) than that from the P (0.54 mu g g(-1)), SiP (0.49 mu g g(-1)) and SiPC (0.49 mu g g(-1)) groups. Lutein in the SAT differed (P<0.05) between all groups with 0.13, 0.10, 0.08 and 0.04 mu g g(-1) the P. SiP, SiPC and C groups, respectively. Principal component analysis of the carotenoid data, SAT colour variables ['L', 'a', 'b', 'C', 'H'] and the reflectance data made it possible to distinguish between the animals fed a barley-based concentrate diet and the animals fed pasture-based diets, but not between different pasture-based groups.

AB The analysis of stable isotopes applied to the lamb meat matrix is recognized as a technique of choice not only for geographical traceability but also for verifying the correspondence between the diet provided and the prescribed one. Indeed, a large amount of information is stored in animal tissues in terms of stable isotopes relative abundances of different elements. The purpose of this review is to critically analyze all the studies carried out on lambs, focusing in particular on the isotope ratios of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, hydrogen and oxygen of different matrices, trying to define the different ranges of variability based on the origin and diet of the lambs. Carbon is certainly the most useful for identifying the animal diet while oxygen and hydrogen confirm their ability to geographically discriminate lambs. Overall, the results of statistical models validating isotope traceability systems can reach and exceed 90% of accuracy.

AB Digitalised supply-chain traceability systems can offer wide prospects both for improving safety as well as enhancing perceived quality. However, the coupling between physical goods and information is often difficult for agri-food items. A solution could be the use of RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) systems. Due to its wide reading range, Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) technology is already widely used in logistics and warehousing, mostly for the identification of batches of items. A growing interest is also emerging in Near Field Communication (NFC), as several smartphones embed an integrated NFC antenna. This paper deals with the automatic identification of meat products at item level, proposing and evaluating the adoption of different RFID technologies. Different UHF and NFC solutions are proposed, which benchmark tag performances in different configurations, including four meat types (fatty beef, lean beef, chicken and pork), by using a specifically designed test bench. As avoiding the application of two different tags could be advantageous, dual frequency devices (UHF and NFC) are also considered. Significant differences in tag performances, which also depend on meat type and packaging, are highlighted. The paper highlights that tag positioning should consider the geometry of the packaging and the relative positioning of tag, meat and reader antenna.

AB This review explores the possibilities to determine livestock consumption of genetically modified (GM) feeds ingredients including detection of genetically modified organism (GMO)-related DNA or proteins in animal samples, and the documentary system that is in place for GM feeds under EU legislation. The presence and level of GMO-related DNA and proteins can generally be readily measured in feeds, using established analytical methods such as polymerase chain reaction and immuno-assays, respectively. Various technical challenges remain, such as the simultaneous detection of multiple GMOs and the identification of unauthorized GMOs for which incomplete data on the inserted DNA may exist. Given that transfer of specific GMO-related DNA or protein from consumed feed to the animal had seldom been observed, this cannot serve as an indicator of the individual animal's prior exposure to GM feeds. To explore whether common practices, information exchange and the specific GM feed traceability system in the EU would allow to record GM feed consumption, the dairy chain in Catalonia, where GM maize is widely grown, was taken as an example. It was thus found that this system would neither enable determination of an animal's consumption of specific GM crops, nor would it allow for quantitation of the exposure. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Traceability of local and typical food products is essential for market protection and consumer trust. DNA analysis is the most dependable tool to identify the biological materials present in a food product. In this work, we molecularly characterized an important local product of the Umbria region, a lentil landrace named after the village Castelluccio di Norcia, in the province of Perugia, Italy, awarded the Protected Geographic Indication (PGI) "Lenticchia di Castelluccio di Norcia" by the European Union in 1997. Four accessions from a 1994 collection were compared with accessions acquired in 2016 at local retailers, in comparison with two commercial samples from grocery stores and two foreign varieties. Twelve simple sequence repeat (SSR) molecular markers allowed to clearly establish the genetic distinctiveness of local lentil. High allelic diversity and very low heterozygosity were observed in Castelluccio samples. The 1994 materials were closely related, as shown by pairwise Fst and by Principal Coordinates Analysis. Little divergence between 1994 and 2016 samples was found, possibly due to 20 years of cultivation in different farms, but one of the 2016 samples was unrelated, as were the two commercial samples. The genetic identity of the Castelluccio landrace is still preserved locally, but may be put at risk by the presence on the market of unrelated materials labeled as PGI. In Castelluccio accessions, as many as 42 private SSR alleles were documented, which can be implemented to develop molecular traceability tests.

AB Stress response caused by transportation is an important reason that affects the health and welfare of livestock, and the intelligent and precise monitoring of the stress state during transportation is a blank in research. On-site tracking experiments, literature review, and expert consultation indicate that environmental temperature, relative humidity and vibration intensity of vehicle are important stressors in the transportation process, and cortisol (COR) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) are the key biomarkers to characterize the stress level. In this paper, stressors causing stress response were collected through environmental sensor network, and key biomarkers representing stress response were identified through biochemical analysis, and their change rules were analyzed and compared. Furthermore, the predictive models coupled with environmental parameters and stress markers were constructed through supervised learning networks. The results showed that: (1) After testing, the data collection performance of the multi-sensor network is reliable (P < 0.05); transportation will cause significant changes in the concentration of COR and ACTH (P 0.05); the simulation results of stress markers data have no significant difference compared with the sample data (PSpline PPchip > 0.90). (2) The validation results of models showed that: for COR, the absolute error and relative error based on general regression neural network (GRNN) are 2.59 +/- 0.16 ng/mL and 1.30 +/- 0.07%, respectively, which is better than the accuracy based on back propagation neural network (BPNN) and Elman neural network (Elman); for ACTH, the absolute error and relative error based on GRNN models were 1.75 +/- 0.13 pg/mL and 2.14 +/- 0.17%, respectively, which were better than the accuracy based on BPNN and Elman models. (3) For the prediction performance, the prediction accuracy of GRNN model for COR concentration is basically equal to that of Elman model, which is 0.17% higher than that of BPNN model for COR concentration, but the maximum relative error of BPNN model for COR concentration is the smallest. The prediction accuracy of Elman model for ACTH concentration is 0.09% higher than that of GRNN model, and 0.29% higher than that of BPNN model. But the maximum relative error of Elman model for ACTH concentration is the largest, and the running time is significantly longer. Although the performance of the three modeling methods is different, their overall accuracy has reached more than 97%. Therefore, this study can effectively identify the stress state of mutton sheep in the actual transportation process, and provide technical support for the health traceability and control of mutton sheep.

AB Through the supply chain, the quality or quality change of the products can generate important losses. The quality control in some steps is made manually that supposes a high level of subjectivity, controlling the quality and its evolution using automatic systems can suppose a reduction of the losses. Testing some automatic image analysis techniques in the case of tomatoes and zucchini is the main objective of this study. Two steps in the supply chain are considered, the feeding of the raw products into the handling chain (because low quality generates a reduction of the chain productivity) and the cool storage of the processed products (as the value at the market is reduced). It was proposed to analyze the incoming products at the head the processing line using CCD cameras to detect low quality and/or dirty products (corresponding to specific farmers/suppliers, it should be asked to improve to maintain the productivity of the line). The second stage is analyzing the evolution of the products along the cool chain (storage and transport), the use of an App developed to be use under Android was proposed to substitute the "visual" evaluation used in practice. The algorithms used, including stages of pre-treatment, segmentation, analysis and presentation of the results take account of the short time available and the limited capacity of the batteries. High performance techniques were applied to the homography stage to discard some of the images, resulting in better performance. Also threads and renderscript kernels were created to parallelize the methods used on the resulting images being able to inspect faster the products. The proposed method achieves success rates comparable to, and improving, the expert inspection.

AB The implementation of the blockchain technology in the agri-food supply chains is in its introductory phase. Lead companies, often retailers, introduce this technology for specific objectives, such as assuring traceability or improving sales and reputation. At the same time, the technology could impact much more broadly the per-formances of food chains. Little is known about this impact as the evidence provided in the literature is scarce and mostly focused on specific indicators. This paper addresses this gap assessing the impact of the blockchain technology on food supply chains from an explorative perspective. An integrated conceptual framework is proposed which includes a broad set of performance dimensions discussed in the literature: efficiency, flexibility, responsiveness, food quality, and transparency of supply chains. These dimensions are assessed using a case study, consisting of three supply chains where a large European retailer has promoted the blockchain adoption. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews with key managers at different stages of the three supply chains and were systematically analysed through a thematic analysis. Results reveal that blockchain technology impacts positively on the profit and/or return on investment of supply chains, it leads to an increase of extrinsic food quality attributes and it fosters a better information management along the food chains due to an improved information accessibility, availability and sharing. The current analysis also suggests an improved management of behavioural uncertainty among the agents of the supply chains and an increase of firm's knowledge as well as supply chain management competencies. While the study remains of explorative nature, it offers a basis for the selection of theoretical approaches and the formulation of new hypotheses for future blockchain studies.

AB The identification of agricultural food production systems has gained importance in order to protect both human health and the environment. The importance of organic production system of agriculture which involves the application of natural processes and substances, and limits or completely eliminates the use of synthesized means is emphasized. Knowledge of the mineral composition in tomato samples can be used as a potent tool in the identification of chemical markers as potential indicators of the farming system. A set of tomato samples taken from two factorial randomized trials were comprehended eight different varieties, belonging to four tomato types: large-BEEF and CLUSTER, and mini and midi-CHERRY and PLUM tomatoes, cultivated under two different farming systems: integral (IPM) and organic (O) were characterized based on the composition of the minerals. A total of 44 elements were quantified. To establish criteria for the classification of the samples and confirm a unique set of parameters of variation among the types of production, sophisticated chemometric techniques were used. The results indicate that the accumulation of elements varies between 8 tomato varieties and 2 different growing systems. The contents of Al, Mn, As, Pb, and some of the rare-earth elements (REEs) are able to distinguish between production types. Examination of different hybrids, which belong to different types in two production systems: organic and integral within Zeleni hit (official Enza and Vitalis trial and breeding station), was done with the aim of reaching a methodology of diversification, ie complete traceability of organic production, and to contribute to distinguishing types of agricultural systems and enhancing the possibility of acquiring a valuable authenticity factor about the type of agricultural production system employed for the cultivation of tomatoes.</p>

AB Microsatellites are ubiquitously distributed, polymorphic repeat sequence valuable for association, selection, population structure and identification. They can be mined by genomic library, probe hybridization and sequencing of selected clones. Such approach has many limitations like biased hybridization and selection of larger repeats. In silico mining of polymorphic markers using data of various genotypes can be rapid and economical. Available tools lack in some or other aspects like: targeted user defined primer generation, polymorphism discovery using multiple sequence, size and number limits of input sequence, no option for primer generation and e-PCR evaluation, transferability, lack of complete automation and user-friendliness. They also lack the provision to evaluate published primers in e-PCR mode to generate additional allelic data using re-sequenced data of various genotypes for judicious utilization of previously generated data. We developed the tool (PolyMorphPredict) using Perl, R, Java and launched at Apache which is available at http://webtom.cabgrid.res.in/polypred/. It mines microsatellite loci and computes primers from genome/transcriptome data of any species. It can perform e-PCR using published primers for polymorphism discovery and across species transferability of microsatellite loci. Present tool has been evaluated using five species of different genome size having 21 genotypes. Though server is equipped with genomic data of three species for test run with gel simulation, but can be used for any species. Further, polymorphism predictability has been validated using in silico and in vitro PCR of four rice genotypes. This tool can accelerate the in silico microsatellite polymorphism discovery in re-sequencing projects of any species of plant and animal for their diversity estimation along with variety/breed identification, population structure, MAS, QTL and gene discovery, traceability, parentage testing, fungal diagnostics and genome finishing.

AB Chile, the major exporter of blueberries in South America, grows two species commercially, the highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) and the rabbiteye blueberry (Vaccinium ashei Reade). Considering the increasing demands for this fruit, it is necessary to have reliable methods for genotyping and genetic traceability of the commercially grown cultivars. In this study, an inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) marker-based system was established to perform the genetic identification of these cultivars. Ten cultivars of V. corymbosum: 'Bluecrop', 'Bluegold', 'Duke', 'Elliott', 'Legacy', 'Misty', 'Nelson', 'O'Neal', 'Sierra' and 'Toro' and three of V. ashei: 'Climax', 'Premier' and 'Tifblue' were analyzed. The sensitivity and reliability of this molecular marker system was compared with identification by simple sequence repeats (SSR). Six ISSR primers were used and high levels of polymorphism among the cultivars (80% of polymorphic loci) were detected, with high repeatability. Using individual primers, distinguishing among cultivars was possible in three cases. However, using pairs of ISSR primers provided greater reliability in cultivar identification. This ISSR-based technology is a simpler, faster, and less expensive alternative to SSRs for genotyping blueberry cultivars and can be used in genetic traceability studies as well as genetic improvement programs.

AB The feasibility of using DataMatrix (DM) barcodes laser printed onto the beaks of poultry as a possible method of identification and therefore traceability of the individual was examined in this study, including a preliminary live trial on broiler chicks in a commercial environment. In vitro trials were initially conducted to select the optimal laser type and the optimal laser settings for this particular application. Frozen mature chicken head samples were sourced from commercial partners and DM barcodes were printed on the beaks of these samples and read using a high specification camera based 1-Dimensional/2-Dimensional DataMan 7500 barcode reader. A number of laser types and settings were assessed through a detailed Predetermined Readability Screening Procedure principally designed to examine the ability of the printed DM barcode to withstand physical abrasion such as that which may occur in a commercial environment. Following this selection process a preliminary live trial of this technology was instigated in a commercial broiler house to examine not only the effects of the growth of the broilers on the clarity and readability of the DM barcode, but also the ability of the printed DM barcodes to resist the physical and chemical environment of a commercial setting. The results show a four day window during which the barcode readability remains at a high level. Thereafter the readability deteriorates rapidly, due to the rapid growth and healing of the beak of broiler chicks. However, with high readability rates, even for such a short timeframe, this technology could well be used as a technique for movement control for live poultry, for example, from the producer to the processor, thereby preventing any fraud at these vulnerable points in the poultry food chain, where there is a transfer of ownership. The effects of such a treatment on the behaviour and weight gain of the broiler chicks was also observed, because in an industry where numbers are large and margins very small, it is important that any additional input to the system would not have any detrimental effect on final carcase weight and quality.

AB BACKGROUND The adulteration of high-priced olive oil with low-cost oils and the fraudulent labelling of oil products make the identification and traceability of vegetable oil species in the food chain very important. This paper describes a high-resolution melting analysis-based method using chloroplast barcoding regions as target (Bar-HRM) to obtain barcoding information for the major vegetable oil species and to quantitatively identify the botanical origin of plant oils. The detection of adulteration of olive oil with canola oil was used as a case study. RESULTS The proposed method was capable of distinguishing among different vegetable oil species and detecting a level of 1% (w/w) of canola oil in olive oil. CONCLUSION Bar-HRM analysis is a more accurate, faster and less costly alternative method to authenticate vegetable oils, including olive oil, and to detect mixtures of oils.

AB Genetic engineering promises to bring important and rapid leaps in food production. It will affect all steps of the production chain, from farm to final food processing. As a biotechnological practice, it has the potential to be used as an effective tool to address the various problems in food and society. Nowadays, our production-to-consumption food system is complex, and consumer needs are growing toward food which is safe, nutritious, abundant, diverse, and less costly. Therefore, scientific and technological advancements must be accelerated and applied in developed and developing countries alike if we are to feed a growing world population. This chapter deals with an analytical perspective on the food applications of genetic engineering that made possible the modern production-to-consumption food system capable of feeding nearly seven billion people, and it also discusses the benefits of this promising biotechnological tool to enhance the food supply in terms of quantity and quality even further and to increase the health and wellness of the growing global population. However, as with any new technology, careful consideration of the effects of employing these tools is necessary to ensure that the result will be a net benefit to humanity. Recent controversies about genetically engineered foods have highlighted the need to allay consumer fears by applying the reliable techniques of traceability and also providing more experimental evidence and sound scientific judgment to assess the risks versus benefits.

AB North American holly (Ilex Verticillata), deciduous shrub of the Aquifoliaceae genus, is commonly known as winterberry, having a high ornamental and medicinal value. The fresh-cut branches of North American holly are prone to rapid deterioration during the cold chain. The paper presents a wireless multi-sensors system to improve postharvest quality of the fresh-cut branches of North American holly in the cold chain. The system was evaluated and validated at a sampled chain from Weihai city to Beijing. The critical ambient parameters including temperature, relative humidity, CO2 and ethylene are real-time monitored and analyzed in fresh-cut branches of the North American holly cold chain. Results show that the system can monitor accurately and transfer steadily data on critical ambient parameters through the logistics process. The traceability system can improve the quality control by tracing the critical ambient parameters and provides an early warning. The quality loss of fresh-cut branches of North American holly decreased from 25% similar to 30% to below 15%, and the market price increased from below 20yuan/bundle to above 50yuan/bundle, which heighten benefit of cold chain.

AB China is the world's largest exporter of Boletus, and Yunnan Province is the largest producer of Boletus eduils in China. The delicious Boletus eduils is fragrant and nutritious, and it is popular among consumers. However, due to different geographical climates and environmental differences, the quality is uneven. The production of Boletus edulis in different production areas in Yunnan Province was identified and the quality control was improved. In this study, 124 samples of delicious Boletus edulis from 13 producing areas around Yunnan were collected, using Fourier to transformed mid-infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-MIR), Fourier transform near-infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-NIR) and UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis). Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry was used to determine the spectral information and mineral content of different parts and analyze them. The original spectrum is smoothed (Savitzky-Golay SG) second derivative SD, standard normal variate (SNV) and other pre-processing. The data is divided into a training set and prediction set by Kennard-Stone classification. The classification model is established by partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and support vector machine (SVM) and then the comparative analysis is carried out to find the best method of origin identification. The results show that: (1) The recovery rate of standard tea materials in the element determination method is between 91.00% and 106.00% and the method is accurate and reliable. (2) Boletus edulis is rich in elements K, P, Mg, Na, Ca and the same place of origin in different parts. There are differences between the same parts in different places, which may be different from the enrichment ability of different parts of Boletus eduils. The geographical environment of the place of origin is related. (3) Intermediate fusion extracts important information through Principal component analysis (PCA). The cumulative contribution rate of FTIR-MIR and UV-Vis spectral data reaches 83.50% and 66.70% which can represent important information variables. (4) In the PLS-DA and SVM models, the identification effect of the data after fusion is higher than that of the single data identification, indicating that the data fusion strategy is effective in the identification of delicious bovine liver. (5) Using the Hoteling T2 to perform the outlier tests on data fusion. The results show that the model establishment does not exceed the confidence interval, and the model has accuracy and credibility. (6) The primary fusion and intermediate fusion results of the PLS-DA model are higher than the SVM, indicating that the PLS-DA models intermediate fusion can be used as the best method for identification. Multi-spectral combined with mineral elements in different parts can accurately identify the delicious Boletus eduils from different habitats, and provide an effective analysis method for the regional quality difference evaluation of Yunnan Boletus eduils.

AB Pasta, the Italian product par excellence, is made of pure durum wheat. The use ofTriticum durumderived semolina is in fact mandatory for Italian pasta, in whichTriticum aestivumspecies is considered a contamination that must not exceed the 3% maximum level. Over the last 50 years, various electrophoretic, chemical, and immuno-chemical methods have been proposed aimed to track the possible presence of common wheat in semolina and pasta. More recently, a new generation of methods, based on DNA (DeoxyriboNucleic Acid) analysis, has been developed to this aim. Species traceability can be now enforced by a new technology, namely digital Polymerase Chain Reaction (dPCR) which quantify the number of target sequence present in a sample, using limiting dilutions, PCR, and Poisson statistics. In our work we have developed a duplex chip digital PCR (cdPCR) assay able to quantify common wheat presence along pasta production chain, from raw materials to final products. The assay was verified on reference samples at known level of common wheat contamination and applied to commercial pastas sampled in the Italian market.

AB We report the determination of ammonia (NH3) diffusive sampling rates for six different designs of commercial diffusive samplers (CEH ALPHA sampler, Gradko diffusion tube, Gradko DIFRAM-400, Passam ammonia sampler, and ICS Maugeri Radiello radial sampler (blue and white turbulence barriers)), together with the validation test results for a pumped sampler (CEH DELTA denuder). The devices were all exposed in the UK's National Physical Laboratory's (NPL) controlled atmosphere test facility (CATFAC). For each of the seven diffusive sampler exposure tests there were traceable concentrations of ammonia (in the range 3-25 mu g m(-3)) generated under well-defined conditions of temperature, relative humidity and wind speed, which are applicable to a variety of ambient monitoring environments. The sampler exposure time at each concentration was 28 days, except for the radial devices, which were exposed for 14 days. The work relied on the dilution of newly developed stable Primary Standard Gas Mixtures (PSMs) prepared by gravimetry in passivated gas cylinders as a method of improving the metrological traceability of ammonia measurements. The exposed diffusive samplers were sent blind to the participants for analysis and the reported NH3 concentrations were then compared against the known reference concentration. From the results for each sampler type a diffusive sampling rate was calculated and compared against the rate used routinely by the participants. Some measurement results were in good agreement with the known traceable reference concentration (particularly for one diffusive sampler design (ALPHA)), while other devices exhibited over-reading and under-reading (each with a clear bias). The new diffusive sampling rates determined in the laboratory study were then applied to measurements in a field comparison campaign, and this was found to deliver an improvement in agreement between the different devices deployed.

AB Geographical wine traceability is an important topic in the context of wine authentification. Therefore, many researchers have addressed this subject by developing different methodologies based on multivariate analysis of organic and inorganic parameters and also by isotopic signature. The goal of this research was to assess the potential of elemental composition and isotopic signature of lead (Pb-207/Pb-206, Pb-208/(206)Pband Pb-204/Pb-206) and strontium (Sr-87/Sr-86)of wines from three Romanian vineyards, in order to highlight reliable markers for wine geographical origin. The ICP-MS method was used for the concentration determination for 30 elements (Ag, Al, As, Ba, Be, Bi, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Ga, In, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, Rb, Se, Sr, Tl, V, U, Zn, Hg). In this study 10 wines (2 red and 8 white) obtained from 'Merlot', 'Feteasca neagra', 'Feteasca alba', 'Feteasca regala', 'Babeasca gri', '.arba', 'Aligote', 'Sauvignon blanc', 'Muscat Ottonel', 'Italian Riesling' cultivars were investigated. The wine samples were obtained from micro-wine production under conditions of 2014, 2015, 2016 from Dealu Bujorului, Murfatlar and.tefane.ti-Arge. vineyards. The high level of K (148.66 +/- 5.41-633.74 +/- 4.13 mg/L), Mg (88.23 +/- 0.84-131.66 +/- 3.42 mg/L), Ca (49.84 +/- 1.22-89.18 +/- 2.34) and Fe were observed in the wine samples analysed. Heavy metals like Hg, Pb, As and Cd (10.2-315 mu g/L) were found below acceptable limits. Concentration of Na (1 mg/L), Cu (1 mg/L), As (0.2 mg/L), Cd (0.01 mg/L), Zn (5 mg/L) and Pb (0.15 mg/L)metals in analysed wine samples were under Maximum Permissible Limits (MPL), respectively as published by the Organization of Vine and Wine. The variation of the Pb-207/Pb-206, Pb-208/Pb-206, Pb-204/Pb-206 and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio and K/Rb, Ca/Sr of the investigated wine clearly demonstrated that these variables are suitable traces for wine geographical origin determination. The proposed methodology allowed a 100% successful classification of wines according to the region of provenance.

AB Original and elite seeds of agricultural plants are the basis for production of reproductive seeds and contribute to an increase in the production of vegetable products, providing raw materials to processing companies of the republic. Greenhouse varieties and hybrids of vegetable crops have a high potential, have a complex of economically valuable features and can occupy a certain niche in professional and especially amateur vegetable growing. However, implementation of the potential of the created varieties and hybrids of vegetable crops is largely determined by the conditions of seed production. It has been determined, that the situation in the country is when over 85 % of the seeds of vegetable crops used for the production of vegetables are imported. At the same time, the production of the necessary volumes of seeds, which will ensure the standard production of vegetable products for consumption by the population and the manufacturing industry, is not only a factor in the development of the vegetable market, but also a condition for helping to guarantee the country's food security. In this regard, it is necessary to intensify domestic selection and seed production in the vegetable sector. The article substantiates a practice-oriented system of measures for the development of the market of seeds of vegetable crops in the Republic of Belarus, including the following blocks of regulatory action: stimulating the development of the sphere of reproduction of vegetable seeds; improving the accounting of the movement of commodity flows in the market of vegetable seeds; integration of the country into the world system of commodity seed production of vegetable crops; ensuring traceability of seed turnover based on digitalization; development of an integrated technical and economic approach to the implementation of production activities; monitoring of the market of seeds of vegetable crops. The development contains a set of systematized tools, the use of which allows justifying effective management decisions in the field of agro-industrial complex for the effective formation of a favorable organizational and economic environment for the production and sale of competitive seeds of vegetable crops of domestic selection.

DE Food safety; Public Private Partnership; Traceability
ID SAFETY REGULATION; ARRANGEMENTS; PREVENTION; DISEASES
AB Recent food safety crises have led to the development of new collaborations between public authorities and food operators in monitoring food safety. To date, most of the literature has analyzed these collaborations as linked to a regulatory process and as a mean to comply with regulatory standards. In this paper, we take another stand and consider them as specific embedded institutions (meso-institutions) analysing them as Public Private Partnership specific to food safety provision. This new perspective allows us to take into account both information asymmetries and the industry-wide dimension of such programmes. Our overall intention is to provide a general enriched theoretical framework to highlight aligned incentive mechanisms in such partnerships. We then apply our framework to two case studies in order to better understand the main mechanisms at work that could explain their specific functioning and resilience. The two case studies are the cattle traceability system in Quebec (Canada) and monitoring programmes for pesticide residues in the French imports industry of fresh produce. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Traceability is of particular importance for those persons who suffer allergy or intolerance to some food component(s) and need a strict avoidance of the allergenic food. In this paper, methodologies are described to fingerprint the presence of allergenic species such as carrot, tomato, and celery by DNA detection. Three DNA extraction methods were applied on vegetables and foods containing or not containing the allergens, and the results were compared and discussed. Fast SYBR Green DNA melting curve temperature analyses and duplex PCR assays with internal control have been developed for detection of these allergenic vegetables and have been tested on commercial foods. Spiking food experiments were also performed, assessing that limits of detection (LOD) of 1 mg/kg for carrot and tomato DNA and 10 mg/kg for celery DNA have been reached.

AB Respiration chambers are one of the primary sources of data on methane emissions from livestock. This paper describes the results from a coordinated set of chamber validation experiments which establishes the absolute accuracy of the methane emission rates measured by the chambers, and for the first time provides metrological traceability to international standards, assesses the impact of both analyser and chamber response times on measurement uncertainty and establishes direct comparability between measurements made across different facilities with a wide range of chamber designs. As a result of the validation exercise the estimated combined uncertainty associated with the overall capability across all facilities reduced from 25.7% (k = 2, 95% confidence) before the validation to 2.1% (k = 2, 95% confidence) when the validation results are applied to the facilities' data.

AB With assignment methods are generally indicated several statistical approaches that use genetic information to identify or verify membership of individuals or groups of individuals. In the present research, the stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA), the canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) and the discriminant analysis (DA) were used to develop an assignment method based on genotypes obtained from the Illumina's OvineSNP50 BeadChip. The three statistical techniques were used to select the most informative markers for discriminating 21 different sheep populations (20 Italian and 1 Slovenian) and their 5 geographic areas of origin. The procedure selected two reduced pools of markers, 110 and 108, that were able to exactly discriminate the 5 geographic areas and the 21 sheep populations, respectively. Moreover, all animals were correctly allocated in the validation procedure. The obtained results indicated that the combined use of the SDA, CDA, and CD techniques represents an efficient strategy for selecting a reduced pool of highly discriminant markers. These SNPs could be further used to develop a low cost customized essay to trace the breed or the geographic area of animals or derived foodstuffs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wine quality and market value greatly depend on the grapevine varietal composition, which may be characteristic of specific regions. In order to defend the distinct regions, Denominations of Origin were defined to protect against fraudulent practices. In this study, we evaluated the efficiency of two microsatellite-based systems (microsatellite (SSR) and intermicrosatellite (ISSR)) for must varietal composition determination and their potential role in certification purposes. Eleven Vitis vinifera L. varieties from leaf and monovarietal must DNA samples were screened with six SSR and 14 ISSR primers to discriminate polymorphisms. Principal coordinates analysis was performed with DCENTER on the resultant data using unweighted pair group mathematical average and revealed that ISSRs markers were not suitable for certification procedures, whereas nuclear SSR markers presented a complete correspondence between leaf and must samples, demonstrating that they were adequate for traceability purposes.

AB Developing oil palm agroindustry in South Kalimantan involves internal and external factors for its sustainability. The long distance of each stakeholder requires a digitally connected system. The research aimed at identifying criteria, sub-criteria, and alternatives in the developed network model, determine the sensitivity to determine the relevance of actor's role, determine the effectiveness and efficiency before and after implementation of the system, and analyse the level of certainty and importance of assumptions developed. The methods used were surveys, focus group discussions, and questionnaires. Experts in the Analytical Network Process (ANP) method were from academia, business, society and government. Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR) method to analyse supply chain performance involved 178 respondents. The level of certainty and importance of assumptions was with Strategic Assumption Surfacing and Testing (SAST). The results of the analysis show there was an interdependence between the sub-criteria on the specified criteria and alternatives applied to achieve the goals. Pairwise comparisons showed the highest sub-criteria cluster was the replanting program with a weight of 0.662, for alternative cluster the highest priority weight in the system involving all actors playing a role was 0.391, with relevant sensitivity test results. The results of the analysis of effectiveness and efficiency before and after implementation of the system showed an increase in SCOR value for all actors. The results of SAST analysis were in Quadrant I with the highest level of importance and certainty of 7.6 meaning very important and certain. The implications of the research results can be seen in fostering the use of technology in realizing transparency, especially regarding the price, quality, and traceability of fresh fruit bunches, the realization of a monitoring system for policymakers and capital assistance for independent oil palm smallholders.

AB World oilseed trade consists of many closely substitutable commodities, with canola and cottonseed as possible alternatives to soya beans for many purposes. Transgenic events in all three crops have been widely adopted, particularly in North and South America, for compelling economic or agronomic reasons. Despite the close attention from organizations concerned about the potential consequences of transgenic crop adoption, there appears to be no substantiated evidence of transgenic DNA in meat or milk products when such crops are fed to livestock. The global area of these transgenic crops continues to increase. No transgenic canola, cotton or soya bean crops are permitted for commercial cultivation in Europe, and although transgenic feed resources are permitted for import, importers risk shipments being denied entry if the traces of an unauthorized transgenic crop are detected. These tight controls can mean that livestock farmers in the EU are disadvantaged due to restricted access to cheaper feed or higher feed costs, and they are thus loosing a degree of competitive advantage. This paper reviews the extent to which transgenic soya beans have become the 'conventional' method of cultivation elsewhere, and notes implications this has for livestock nutrition, traceability and economics within the EU. The paper concludes with discussion regarding the implications for the EU of delayed acceptance of newly available transgenic traits.

AB Dendrobium is the largest genus of orchids most of which have excellent medicinal properties. Fresh stems of some species have been consumed in daily life by Asians for thousands of years. However, there are differences in flavour and clinical efficacy among different species. Therefore, it is necessary for a detector to establish an effective and rapid method controlling botanical origins of these crude materials. In our study, three spectroscopies including mid-infrared (MIR) (transmission and reflection mode) and near-infrared (NIR) spectra were investigated for authentication of 12 Dendrobium species. Generally, two fusion strategies, reflection MIR and NIR spectra, were combined with three mathematical models (random forest, support vector machine with grid search (SVM-GS) and partial least-squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA)) for discrimination analysis. In conclusion, a low-level fusion strategy comprising two spectra after pretreated by the second derivative and multiplicative scatter correction was recommended for discrimination analysis because of its excellent performance in three models. Compared with MIR spectra, NIR spectra were more responsible for the discrimination according to a bi-plot analysis of PLS-DA. Moreover, SVM-GS and PLSDA were suitable for accurate discrimination (100% accuracy rates) of calibration and validation sets. The protocol combined with low-level fusion strategy and chemometrics provides a rapid and effective reference for control of botanical origins in crude Dendrobium materials.

AB Food loss and waste are two of the many problems that modern society is facing. To date, among many solutions, the circular economy is the one prevailing. A successful transition toward a circular economy (CE) requires the food sector to overcome the challenges of today's complex food supply chains such as information asymmetry, poor cooperation among stakeholders, and concerns about food safety. Blockchain, a form of distributed ledger technology, has been progressively gaining traction in supply chains in areas like data management, certifying product provenance and tracking products. Despite its importance, knowledge around the potential of the blockchain technology in facilitating the transition towards a circular economy in the agri-food sector is fragmented. This review provides evidence-based insights into the blockchain implementations in the food supply chains and the implications for CE. Our findings indicated four major areas that blockchain could accelerate CE in the agri-food sector: improving data utility; supply chain management efficacy; enhanced eco-efficiency; and superior traceability.

AB The first automated grading facilities for fruit and vegetables became available more than 10 years ago. Recently, machine vision and near infrared (NIR) technologies as well as mechatronics and computer technologies have been employed to make these facilities more sophisticated and have led to their use for many kinds of agricultural products. Robot technology has proved able to handle agricultural products delicately and with a high degree of precision, and to gather information to create a database of products every season. This information is then utilized as traceability data for consumers and as farming guidance for producers.

AB The analysis of feed composition in terms of ingredients is addressed by Regulation (EC) 767/2009 and is important for detecting economic fraud and for monitoring feed safety. Within the framework of the EU project Feed-code, we developed and internally validated a modular assay, relying on intron polymorphism, for the complete qualitative analysis of the botanical composition of feed and the quantitative determination of six target plant species. Main performance parameters of each module, such as applicability, repeatability, specificity, and limit of detection, were evaluated. The whole assay was applied to a set of feed-like samples and results were in agreement with the expected composition. Application to a large set of compound feed and individual raw materials revealed the occurrence of botanical impurities. When compared with microscopic analysis, the proposed method gave more reliable results. We conclude that the Feed-code prototype, readily upgradable to include more plant species, is worthy of consideration for a full validation through a collaborative trial.

AB Context. Recent heightened interest of consumers in the origins of their food, together with broader general awareness of environmental matters, has led to an increase in the demand for meat obtained from grazing systems. The importance of local breeds adapted to medium- and low-input production is fully recognised as a means of guaranteeing the sustainability of these farming methods. A finishing system based on pastures and the use of local breeds could both meet the demands of consumers and increase economic returns for Sardinian farmers.
   Aims. The work evaluated the effects of different finishing treatments (pasture PAS-0C vs hay-concentrate-based diets HAY-C) on the quality of meat from young Sarda bulls and the usefulness of meat chemicals as markers to discriminate between finishing systems.
   Methods. Twenty-eight young Sarda bulls were assigned randomly to the following two treatments: finished on natural pasture (PAS-0C group, n = 7), and fed on natural pasture hay ad libitum and concentrate (HAY-C group, n = 21). The latter group comprised three levels characterised by an increasing daily dose of concentrates, as follows: 2.5 kg/animal (HAY-2.5C), 3.3 kg/animal (HAY-3.3C), and ad libitum (HAY-ALC). After slaughter at a fixed age (416 +/- 25 days), carcass yield, pH of the Longissimus thoracis (LT) muscle, colour parameters, cooking loss, proximate analysis, cc-tocopherol and cholesterol concentration, and fatty acid composition of intramuscular fat of LT were all determined. The discriminating power of the meat chemicals between the two main finishing systems (PAS-0C vs HAY-C) and among the three groups receiving concentrates and hay (HAY-2.5C, HAY-3.3C and HAY-ALC) was assessed using linear discriminant analysis.
   Key results. Pasture-based treatment decreased the intramuscular fat and increased the alpha-tocopherol concentration of meat and the proportion of some desirable fatty acids (alpha-linolenic acid and its derivatives eicosapentaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid), and improved the value of the ratio of n-6:n-3, without affecting the ultimate pH, colour parameters, and cooking loss. The discriminant procedure was able to discriminate accurately between the two main finishing systems and among the three groups receiving concentrate and hay (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.005 of the Hotel! ing's T-squared test respectively). The concentration of alpha-tocopherol was key to the discrimination of the two main finishing systems, whereas the content of C17:0 and C 18:0i were particularly effective in discriminating among the three groups fed with hay concentrate.
   Conclusions. Grazing improves some of the meat traits of young Sarda bulls compared with the effects of a hay-concentrate-based finishing diet. The concentration of alpha-tocopherol in meat is an effective marker for discriminating the effects of pasture from those of a concentrate-based finishing diet

AB This research offers the first use of graph theory mathematics in social network analysis to explore relationships built through an alternative food network. The local food system is visualized using geo-social data from 110 farms and 224 markets around Baltimore County, Maryland, with 699 connections between them. Network behavior is explored through policy document review and interviews. The findings revealed a small-world architecture, with system resiliency built-in by diversified marketing practices at central nodes. This robust network design helps to explain the long-term survival of local food systems despite the meteoric rise of global industrial food supply chains. Modern alternative food networks are an example of a movement that seeks to reorient economic power structures in response to a variety of food system-related issues not limited to consumer health but including environmental impacts. Uncovering the underlying network architecture of this sustainability-oriented social movement helps reveal how it weaves systemic change more broadly. The methods used in this study demonstrate how social values, social networks, markets, and governance systems embed to transform both physical landscapes and human bodies. Network actors crafted informal policy reports, which were directly incorporated in state and local official land-use and economic planning documents. Community governance over land-use policy suggests a powerful mechanism for further localizing food systems.

AB Tea is one of the most important beverages worldwide, is produced in several distinct geographical regions, and is traded on the global market. The ability to determine the geographical origin of tea products helps to ensure authenticity and traceability. This paper reviews the recent research on authentication of tea using a combination of instrumental and chemometric methods. To determine the production region of a tea sample, instrumental methods based on analyzing isotope and mineral element contents are suitable because they are less affected by tea variety and processing methods. Chemometric analysis has proven to be a valuable method to identify tea. Principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are the most preferred methods for processing large amounts of data obtained through instrumental component analysis.

AB Energy efficiency of the wireless sensor network (WSN) is one of the dominating issues in the non-stop table grapes cold chain monitoring. The aim of this paper is to propose an energy-efficient sensing method for the non-stop cold chain management of table grapes in order to reduce the average energy consumption of WSN devices and improve the operation and transmission efficiency of WSN, and finally strengthen the transparency, traceability and stabilization in non-stop cold chain monitoring. The energy-efficient sensing in non-stop cold chain monitoring was realized by combining the WSN and the CS transmission mode for the sensor data acquisition and transmission. According to the comprehensive analysis of the environmental performance, the CS performance, the energy consumption of WSN devices, the transmission efficiency and economic performance in actual cold chain of table grapes, the WSN with CS transmission mode could have the sensor data been transmitted with relatively few sampling amount and reconstructed with high accuracy and efficiency. The proposed energy-efficient sensing method could be extended for the non-stop cold chain monitoring applications to improve their energy, operation and transmission efficiency.

AB Application of technology systems is seen in many sectors including agriculture and food. Traditionally, agricultural industry has been solely dependent on human labor with limited application of mechanical equipment and machines. The applications of advanced technology such as embedded computing, robotics, wireless technology, GPS/GIS (Geographical Positioning System/Geographical Information System) and DBMS (Database Management System) software are seen to be recent developments. This paper reviews the applications of technology systems in agriculture and food. Because knowledge on standardization and interfacing plays a key role in using the technology systems in any application domain, this paper aims to highlight the important attributes of such an emerging research area. In particular, the paper describes soil sampling methods and technology applications; field and yield mapping with GPS and GIS; harvesters and future research in robotic-based harvesters; food processing and packaging technology such as traceability and status of RFID networking research; application of sensor network; data management and execution systems; and the automation and control standards such as fieldbus systems and OMAC guidelines.

AB Genetic structure and distinctive features of landraces, such as adaptability to local agro-ecosystems and specific qualitative profiles, can be substantially altered by the massive introduction of allochthonous germplasm. The landrace known as "Cipolla rossa di Acquaviva" (Acquaviva red onion, further referred to as ARO) is traditionally cultivated and propagated in a small area of the Apulia region (southern Italy). However, the recent rise of its market value and cultivation area is possibly causing genetic contamination with foreign propagating material. In this work, genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) was used to characterize genetic variation of seven onion populations commercialized as ARO, as well as one population of the landrace "Montoro" (M), which is phenotypically similar, but originates from another cultivation area and displays different qualitative features. A panel of 5011 SNP markers was used to perform parametric and non-parametric genetic structure analyses, which supported the hypothesis of genetic contamination of germplasm commercialized as ARO with a gene pool including the M landrace. Four ARO populations formed a core genetic group, homogeneous and clearly distinct from the other ARO and M populations. Conversely, the remaining three ARO populations did not display significant differences with the M population. A set of private alleles for the ARO core genetic group was identified, indicating the possibility to trace the ARO landrace by means of a SNP-based molecular barcode. Overall, the results of this study provide a framework for further breeding activities and the traceability of the ARO landrace.

AB Authentication of processed food ingredients is becoming an important issue for customers, and some DNA-based analytical methods have been developed, especially for animal products. As food products typically contain several different ingredients, a current challenge is to increase the multiplexing capacity of DNA-based methods, to develop "all-in-one" assays. Oligonucleotide-coupled, bead-based suspension arrays are sensitive and reproducible multiplex analytical tools. We applied the Multi-Analyte Profile (xMAP (TM)) technology to develop an assay able to concurrently detect five different plant components in mixed flours and in processed feed and food. Capture probes were targeted to species-specific DNA polymorphisms present within the first intron of plant beta-tubulin genes, which can be amplified by the tubulin-based polymorphism-amplification method (TBP-PCR). The workflow is very simple and straightforward, consisting of a PCR amplification step with universal primers, followed by the direct hybridization assay. Results are highly reproducible. For each single plant species, the absolute detection limit was as low as one target DNA copy. In complex mixtures of flours derived from seeds or from commercial dry "pasta," relative limits of detection ranged, in weight, from 2 % for soybean to less than 0.5 % for wheat. The specificity of the capture probes and the high sensitivity of the method allowed the successful determination of the analytical composition of three feeds as well as eleven food samples, such as snacks, biscuits, and pasta. The multiplexing ability of the assay (up to 100 different analytes) provides scalability and flexibility, in response to specific needs.

AB Multi-isotope and multi-elemental analyses were performed on 600 red wine samples imported into China from 7 different countries and compared with Chinese wine. Carbon and oxygen isotopes and 16 elements were used to determine origin traceability. Our goal was to build a classification tool using data modeling that can verify the geographic origin of wines imported into China. Multivariate analyses of the isotopic and elemental data revealed that it is possible to determine the geographical origin for most imported wines with a high level of confidence ( > 90%). The results show that Artificial Neural Network method had a high discrimination accuracy and is more suitable than Discrimination Analysis and Random Forest methods when it comes to classifying wine origin on a global scale. In conclusion, stable isotope and trace element analyses followed by multivariate processing of the data is a fast and efficient technique suitable for global wine traceability.

AB Over the latest decade, lipidomics has been extensively developed to give robust strength to the qualitative and quantitative information of lipid molecules derived from physiological animal tissues and edible muscle foods. The main lipidomics analytical platforms include mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), where MS-based approaches [e.g., "shotgun lipidomics," ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS)] have been widely used due to their good sensitivity, high availability, and accuracy in identification/quantification of basal lipid profiles in complex biological point of view. However, each method has limitations for lipid-species [e.g., fatty acids, triglycerides (TGs), and phospholipids (PLs)] analysis, and necessitating the extension of effective chemometric-resolved modeling and novel bioinformatic strategies toward molecular insights into alterations in the metabolic pathway. This review summarized the latest research advances regarding the application of advanced lipidomics in muscle origin and meat processing. We concisely highlighted and presented how the biosynthesis and decomposition of muscle-derived lipid molecules can be tailored by intrinsic characteristics during meat production (i.e., muscle type, breed, feeding, and freshness). Meanwhile, the consequences of some crucial hurdle techniques from both thermal/non-thermal perspectives were also discussed, as well as the role of salting/fermentation behaviors in postmortem lipid biotransformation. Finally, we proposed the inter-relationship between potential/putative lipid biomarkers in representative physiological muscles and processed meats, their metabolism accessibility, general nutritional uptake, and potency on human health.

AB In today's global food markets, the ability to trace the origins of agricultural products is becoming increasingly important. We developed an efficient procedure for validating the authenticity and origin of tea samples where Partial Least Squares and Euclidean Distance methods, based on near-infrared spectroscopy data, were combined to classify tea samples from different tea producing areas. Four models for identification of authenticity of tea samples were constructed and utilized in our two-step procedure. High accuracy rates of 98.60%, 97.90%, 97.55%, and 99.83% for the calibration set, and 97.19%, 97.54%, 97.83%, 100% for test set, were achieved. After the first identification step, employing the four origin authenticity models, followed by the second step using the Euclidean Distance method, accuracy rates for specific origin identification were 98.43% in the calibration set and 96.84% in the test set. This method, employing two-step analysis of multi-origin model, accurately identified the origin of tea samples collected in four different areas. This study provided a potential reference method for the detection of "geographical indication" of agricultural products' and is available for use in traceability of origin studies.

AB Nairobi is a large rapidly-growing city whose demand for beef, mutton and goat products is expected to double by 2030. The study aimed to map the Nairobi beef, sheep and goat systems structure and flows to identify deficiencies and vulnerabilities to shocks.
   Cross-sectional data were collected through focus group discussions and interviews with people operating in Nairobi ruminant livestock and meat markets and in the large processing companies. Qualitative and quantitative data were obtained about the type of people, animals, products and value adding activities in the chains, and their structural, spatial and temporal interactions. Mapping analysis was done in three different dimensions: people and product profiling (interactions of people and products), geographical (routes of animals and products) and temporal mapping (seasonal fluctuations). The results obtained were used to identify structural deficiencies and vulnerability factors in the system.
   Results for the beef food system showed that 44-55% of the city's beef supply flows through the 'local terminal markets', but that 54-64% of total supply is controlled by one 'meat market'. Numerous informal chains were identified, with independent livestock and meat tradets playing a pivotal role in the functionality of these systems, and where most activities are conducted with inefficient quality control and under scarce and inadequate infrastructure and organisation, generating wastage and potential food safety risks in low quality Meat products. Geographical and temporal analysis showed the critical areas influencing the different markets, with larger markets increasing their market share in the low season. Large processing companies, partly integrated, operate with high quality infrastructures, but with up to 60% of their beef supply depending on similar routes as the informal markets. Only these companies were involved in value addition activities, reaching high-end markets, but also dominating the distribution of popular products, such as beef sausages, to Middle and low-end market. For the small ruminant food system, 73% of the low season supply flows through a single large informal market, Kiamaiko, located in an urban informal settlement. No grading is done for these animals or the meat produced. Large companies were reported to export up to 90% of their products. Lack of traceability and control of animal production was a common feature in all chains.
   The mapping presented provides a framework for policy makers and institutions to understand and design improvement plans for the Nairobi ruminant food system. The structural deficiencies and vulnerabilities identified here indicate the areas of intervention needed. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB At the beginning of the 21st century, the question of food safety is playing an accentuated role in the meat product industry. Important issues within this topic are the risk of bioterrorism, impurities in the food chain, and the ascendancy of consumer needs. The solutions to these problems are the introduction of modern quality assurance systems, product identification, and traceability. This chapter reviews the possibilities of IT support for these systems, as well as the potential advantages and their incidental costs. Within the tight frame of this paper - omitting the descriptions of technologies - we discuss the most important criteria of systems which may be able to solve today's meat industry problems.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform US food systems by targeting its biggest challenges: improving food yield, quality, and nutrition, decreasing resource consumption, increasing safety and traceability, and eliminating food waste. Despite big leaps in AI capacity, food systems present several challenges for the application and adoption of AI: (1) Food systems are highly diverse and biologically complex, (2) ground-truth data is sparse, costly, and privately held, and (3) human decisions and preferences are intricately linked to every stage of food system supply chains. To address these challenges and transform U.S. food systems, the AI Institute for Next Generation Food Systems (AIFS) aims to develop AI technologies and nurture the next generation of talent to produce and distribute more high quality nutritious food with fewer resources. AIFS has six research clusters, including two Foundational Research Areas (Use-Inspired and Foundational AI, and Socioeconomics and Ethics) and four Application Research Areas spanning the entire food supply chain: Molecular Breeding, Agricultural Production, Food Processing and Distribution, and Nutrition. AIFS is developing generalizable, data efficient, and trustworthy AI solutions based on a knowledge-driven and human-in-the loop learning paradigm designed to handle food system diversity and biological complexity, efficiently capture, and utilize food system data, and garner user trust via explainability, safety, privacy, and fairness.

AB The creation of genetic resource cryobanks provides a crucial link between in situ and ex situ techniques to improve the efficiency of conservation programs. Aim of the present review is to describe all the activities developed for the implementation of the first Italian Semen Cryobank of Autochthonous Chicken and Turkey Breeds. These activities can be classified into three main topics: (1) identification of species-specific semen freezing/thawing reference procedures; (2) drafting Standard Operative Procedures (SOP) for the implementation of the semen cryobank; (3) storage of semen doses from Italian chicken and turkey breeds to establish the cryobank. Several trials have been developed to identify a specie-specific semen cryopreservation protocol for chickens and turkeys. The major results are reviewed and a final reference protocol described. Taking into consideration the FAO guidelines for cryoconservation of animal genetic resources, SOP were drafted with the aim to provide technical guidance and logistical support on the choice of priority breeds, selection of birds for semen production, infrastructures and storage sites, birds and semen management, cryopreservation process and doses traceability. Lastly, the Italian Semen Cryobank was created. A total of 112 semen doses from 22 cockerels of three breeds, and 74 doses from 12 turkey males of three breeds were stored in the Cryobank. Breed specific semen quality parameters assessed before and after cryopreservation are reported. The described activities provide information and tools useful for the implementation of semen cryobanking in avian species and might be transferred also to other species after appropriate adaptations.

AB Frequent meat frauds have become a global issue because adulteration risks the food safety, breaches market rules, and even threatens public health. Multiplex PCR is considered to be a simple, fast, and inexpensive technique that can be applied for the identification of meat products in food industries. However, relatively less is known about a multiplex PCR method authenticating seven animal species simultaneously in one reaction due to technological challenge. Through screening new species-specific primers and optimizing PCR system, a heptaplex PCR method was established, which could simultaneously detect seven meat ingredients of camel (128 bp), pigeon (157 bp), chicken (220 bp), duck (272 bp), horse (314 bp), beef (434 bp), and pork (502 bp) in a single-tube reaction. DNA sequencing solidly validated that each set of primers specifically amplified target species from total DNA mixtures of seven meat species. The developed multiplex assay was stable and sensitive enough to detect 0.01-0.025 ng DNA from various meat treatments including raw, boiled, and autoclaved meat samples or target meat content of 0.1% total meat weight, suggesting the suitability of the heptaplex PCR technique for tracing target meats with high accuracy and precision. Most importantly, a market survey validated the availability of this multiplex PCR technique in real-world meat products with a good application foreground.

AB Food security and safety are central topics worth to be investigated by academicians and practitioners. Radio frequency identification (RFID) is more than a tool with wireless microchips for identification but a facilitator that increases the traceability of food products and better business model innovations. This paper reviews the literature of issues regarding RFID in the context of food supply chains (e.g. issues on the feasibility of RFID for better food traceability). We make a careful review of 13 papers published in 9 SSCI journals and conferences published from 2004 to 2016. Findings are discussed for offering suggestions that could improve the research streams and practices.

ID SCHEMES; SECURE; CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB Group signature scheme provides a way to sign messages without revealing identities of the authentic signers. To achieve such functionality and to avoid the abuse of its power, anonymity and traceability are two essential properties for group signature scheme. In traditional group signature schemes, however, these two security properties are based on the perfectly-secure storage of secret information. Unfortunately, defective implementation of a cryptosystem always exists, and therefore unexpected information leakage is inevitable. In reality, side-channel attacks allow an adversary breaks the security of the whole system by eavesdropping a portion of secret information. To tackle this issue, in our work we present the security models of leakage-resilient group signature in bounded leakage setting and furthermore, propose three new black-box constructions of leakage-resilient group signature based on the proposed security models.

AB Food integrity is a general term for sound, nutritive, healthy, tasty, safe, authentic, traceable, as well as ethically, safely, environment-friendly, and sustainably produced foods. In order to verify these properties, analytical methods with a higher degree of accuracy, sensitivity, standardization and harmonization and a harmonized system for their application in analytical laboratories are required. In this view, metrology offers the opportunity to achieve these goals. In this perspective article the current global challenges in food analysis and the principles of metrology to fill these gaps are presented. Therefore, the pan-European project METROFOOD-RI within the framework of the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) was developed to establish a strategy to allow reliable and comparable analytical measurements in foods along the whole process line starting from primary producers until consumers and to make all data findable, accessible, interoperable, and re-usable according to the FAIR data principles. The initiative currently consists of 48 partners from 18 European Countries and concluded its "Early Phase" as research infrastructure by organizing its future structure and presenting a proof of concept by preparing, distributing and comprehensively analyzing three candidate Reference Materials (rice grain, rice flour, and oyster tissue) and establishing a system how to compile, process, and store the generated data and how to exchange, compare them and make them accessible in data bases.

AB BACKGROUND Food security can benefit from the technology's transparency, relatively low transaction costs and instantaneous applications. A blockchain is a distributed database of records in the form of encrypted blocks, or a public ledger of all transactions or digital events that have been executed and shared among participating parties and can be verified at any time in the future. Generally, the robust and decentralized functionality of the blockchain is used for global financial systems, but it can easily be expanded to contracts and operations such as tracking of the global supply chain. In the precision agriculture context, Information and Communications Technology can be further implemented with a blockchain infrastructure to enable new farm systems and e-agriculture schemes. RESULTS The purpose of this review is to show a panorama of the scientific studies (enriched by a terms mapping analysis) on the use of blockchain in the agri-food sector, from both an entirely computational and an applicative point of view. As evidenced by the network analysis, the reviewed studies mainly focused on software aspects (e.g. the architecture and smart contracts). However, some aspects regarding the different blockchain knots (computers always connected to the blockchain network) having the role to store and distribute an updated copy of each block in a food supply-chain, result of crucial importance. CONCLUSION These technologies appear very promising and rich of great potential showing a good flexibility for applications in several sectors but still immature and hard to apply due to their complexity.

AB A PCR-RFLP method has been developed for the identification of 16 commercial sea cucumber species in raw and processed food products. To implement the method, PCR amplification with the 16Sar/16Sbr primers, targeted to the amplification of a ca. 570 bp region of the 16S rRNA mitochondrial gene in sea cucumbers, was coupled to restriction analysis with Dde I, Hae Ill and Sty I. We also report the FINS method based on 16S rRNA mitochondrial sequences. Both proposed methodologies were independently applied to authenticate the species of 19 commercial products, showing that 9 products were incorrectly labeled (48%). Therefore, the 16S rRNA mitochondrial gene really provide convenient, useful and academic molecular marker to study questions related to correct labeling of commercial products, traceability, and the control of sea cucumber fisheries.

AB This paper describes the design and testing of a wearable position recording system for workers in orchards or in protected cultivation environments, where GPS data are typically unavailable. The major goal of the wearable system is to track worker position in relation to trees. This system consists of a pedometer and a small barcode reader and utilizes barcode tags permanently attached to fixed objects of known location (e.g., individual trees in an orchard). The pedometer computes a worker's relative displacement with respect to a known starting position, and the barcode provides the absolute (starting) position information at regular intervals to keep the localization error at an acceptable level. Evaluations of the accuracy and reliability of the pedometer revealed a 2-3% accumulated error in the estimation of the worker's position. The use of the pedometer alone was insufficient and could not establish correctly the association between trees and workers. The prototype system was implemented and tested during manual harvest in two commercial peach orchards. The fruit pickers' movements were captured accurately and the association between producing tree(s) and fruit picker, as well as the sequence of the trees which the picker visited, were established correctly.

AB The effect of animal feeding on milk volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of metabolic origin was tested on a hay-based diet (H), a highly diversified pasture under continuous grazing (CG), or a less diversified pasture under rotational grazing (RG). Individual milk of 24 Montbeliarde cows (8 per treatment) were sampled after 2 weeks. Pasture-derived milk was richer (p < 0.05) in camphene, sabinene, beta-caryophyllene, and skatole than H milk. Neither milk yield nor fat content affected the majority of VOCs measured. Skatole increased slightly with milk yield, while indole and cineole decreased slightly with milk fat content but with poor regression (R-2 < 0.54). Multivariate analysis showed that, on the basis of those VOCs of metabolic origin whose concentration differed between treatment (dimethyl-sulfone, skatole, toluene, undecanoic acid, 1-octadecene, benzeneacetaldehyde, octanoic acid, and 2-pentanone-4-hydroxy-4-methyl), it was possible to obtain good discriminations among feeding systems. This study is promising for a future use of VOCs of metabolic origin to trace animal feeding systems.

AB The presence of inaccurate food identification is an increasing global concern. The occurrence of species substitution in the fish and meat sectors has been documented in numerous cases. In comparison, there is much less information on the incidence of food mislabeling in the plant sector, where variety substitution is the most frequent problem. Our aim was to reveal possible mislabeling of commercial tomato products by a means of molecular genetic analysis. We focused our study on the "San Marzano" because it is considered among the most important industrial tomato in the world and fetches a higher market price. Since 1996, an EU Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) scheme guarantees the authenticity and origin of the true "San Marzano" production. In this work, SSRs were tested on 20 tomato varieties, validated on foodstuff and then employed to establish the genetic identity of 25 commercial tins labeled as "San Marzano". SSR fingerprint was able to reveal that cans contained fruits that do not have the genetic profile of the 'San Marzano sel: 2' or 'Kiros' varieties, the only ones allowed for the production of PDO labeled products. Our work proved the usefulness of DNA-based tools to guarantee the authenticity of premium plant varieties. Furthermore, it strongly prompted the introduction of DNA tests for the control and law enforcement in agro-food chain. Our work demonstrated that SSR fingerprint could be used to optimize business objectives and match consumers' demand of authentic plant-derived foodstuff. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study describes the implementation of a food safety system in the dairy pilot plant "Gourmeticus Academicum," a spin-off within the University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine of Cluj Napoca, Romania. In order to improve Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points (HACCP) the preliminary programs were integrated into the quality management system (QMS) by monitoring the biological hazards. The process provides future specialists with good practice hands-on and educational tools. This study focused on hazard analysis, the determination and establishment of prerequisite programs, and the role of critical control points (CCPs) based on HACCP and the challenges found during the process as a critical thinking model on education programs. The determination of the CCPs in the processing of yogurt was made by applying the decision tree method. Besides, biological hazards are included as a by-control of the system's implementation performance. For the successful implementation of HACCP principles, prerequisite programs (PRPs) and operational prerequisite programs (OPRPs) were initially implemented. This process could be challenging but feasible to be reached in small-scale food industries with remarkable results as educational tools.

AB BackgroundEffective animal health surveillance systems require reliable, high-quality, and timely data for decision making. In Tanzania, the animal health surveillance system has been relying on a few data sources, which suffer from delays in reporting, underreporting, and high cost of data collection and transmission. The integration of data from multiple sources can enhance early detection and response to animal diseases and facilitate the early control of outbreaks. This study aimed to identify and assess existing and potential data sources for the animal health surveillance system in Tanzania and how they can be better used for early warning surveillance. The study used a mixed-method design to identify and assess data sources. Data were collected through document reviews, internet search, cross-sectional survey, key informant interviews, site visits, and non-participant observation. The assessment was done using pre-defined criteria.ResultsA total of 13 data sources were identified and assessed. Most surveillance data came from livestock farmers, slaughter facilities, and livestock markets; while animal dip sites were the least used sources. Commercial farms and veterinary shops, electronic surveillance tools like AfyaData and Event Mobile Application (EMA-i) and information systems such as the Tanzania National Livestock Identification and Traceability System (TANLITS) and Agricultural Routine Data System (ARDS) show potential to generate relevant data for the national animal health surveillance system. The common variables found across most sources were: the name of the place (12/13), animal type/species (12/13), syndromes (10/13) and number of affected animals (8/13). The majority of the sources had good surveillance data contents and were accessible with medium to maximum spatial coverage. However, there was significant variation in terms of data frequency, accuracy and cost. There were limited integration and coordination of data flow from the identified sources with minimum to non-existing automated data entry and transmission.ConclusionThe study demonstrated how the available data sources have great potential for early warning surveillance in Tanzania. Both existing and potential data sources had complementary strengths and weaknesses; a multi-source surveillance system would be best placed to harness these different strengths.

AB Due to the particularity of origin area, the yield and price of Tibetan chicken are different from those in the plain areas, which leads to chickens from the plains being disguised as Tibetan chickens. In present study, Tibetan chicken and chicken from other four provinces in plain areas were distinguished by stable isotopes and chemometric methods. The cross-validation rate was 97.6%. Secondly, correlation between mean 613C, 615N, 62H and 618O values in chicken samples and environmental parameters was investigated. These indicators are closely related to geographical environment. 613C and 615N values were positively correlated with longitude (R = 0.955) and altitude (R = 0.796), respectively. 618O and 62H values were negatively correlated with latitude (R = 0.903) and altitude (R = 0.938), respectively. At last, we used stable isotopes to trace Tibetan chicken from the different area of Tibet. When four stable isotope ratios were combined, we can distinguish them.

AB BACKGROUND: Freezing represents an important storage method for vegetal foodstuffs, such as cowpea pods, and thus the impact of this process on the chemical composition of these matrices arises as a prominent issue. In this sense, the phytochemical contents in frozen cowpea pods (i.e. at 6 and 9 months) have been compared with fresh cowpea pods material, with the samples being concomitantly assessed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), both mid-infrared (MIR) and near infrared (NIR), aiming to evaluate the potential of these techniques as a rapid tool for the traceability of these matrices.
   RESULTS: A decrease in phytochemical contents during freezing was observed, allowing the classification of samples according to the freezing period based on such variations. Also, MIR and NIR allowed discrimination of samples: the use of the first derivative demonstrated a better performance for this purpose, whereas the use of the normalized spectra gave the best correlations between the spectra and specific contents. In both cases, NIR displayed the best performance.
   CONCLUSION: Freezing of cowpea pods leads to a decrease of phytochemical contents, which can be monitored by FTIR spectroscopy, both within the MIR and NIR ranges, whereas the use of this technique, in tandem with chemometrics, constitutes a suitable methodology for the traceability of these matrices.

AB In order to integrate Web-based tools in plant pathology for storing, updating and sharing information, an electronic identification system based on radiofrequency technology was used for linking plants or samples to associated data. Radiofrequency identification microchips working at low or ultra high frequency were associated to different items such as organism, matrix or container commonly involved in a plant pathology test. Moreover, the microchips were subjected to various environmental conditions, such as thermal and chemical stress. A collaborative Web 2.0-based workspace was used to support research data management and interaction between users. Our findings demonstrate that the microchips maintained their reliability following environmental treatments, while the selected Web 2.0 collaborative workspace allowed useful data interchange and communications between labs during long-term trials as sanitary selection of grapevine.

AB This paper aims to study the volatile composition of monovarietal extra-virgin olive oils from different varieties from Alentejo region (Portugal). Volatile profile of 82 olive oils was performed by head-space solid phase microextraction hyphenated with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC/MS). A total of 107 volatile compounds, belonging to several class of compounds, like aldehydes, hydrocarbons, alcohols, terpenoids, ketones, sulphurous compounds, acids and esters were identified, assigned to a specific biogenic origin and total abundances were plotted in modified 3D van Krevelen diagrams. The 3D plots showed that there are compositional differences among olive oil varieties. Discriminant analysis confirmed that the pattern of volatile compounds includes enough information to group sample variety amongst discrete monovarietal olive oil. Combining statistical analysis (t-Student) and graphical-tools (van Krevelen diagram) seems to be a powerful tool to determine what molecular families were characteristic of each olive oil variety, contributing to the valorization of monovarietal Portuguese olive oil.

AB Avocado (Persea americana Mill) is a fruit consumed worldwide due to its valuable organoleptic and health-promoting properties. To date, no information is available about the isotopic composition of this foodstuff and this study determines the stable isotope composition of five bio-elements (C, N, S, H and O) and the composition profile of 46 macro, micro and trace elements. The stable isotope and elemental profiles were determined in 131 avocados from different producing regions (Spain, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Kenya, Mexico, Peru, South Africa) collected over three years to study the main geographical differences. A PLS-DA model was performed combining the stable isotopes with the elemental profile, making it possible to distinguish the Spanish from the non-Spanish avocados with a high prediction accuracy (98% correct classification). The results of this study highlight the potential of stable isotope ratios and elemental profiles for tracing the geographical origin of avocados.

AB Simple Summary
   Informatization can effectively improve the production and management efficiency in the poultry farming process. In this study, a management system was designed to realize the acquisition, transmission, storage, and management of information, and upload the data to the cloud database to increase the flexibility and scalability of the system. On the basis of realizing production management functions, the system also incorporates an office management module, thus forming a complete data chain in production activities, so as to conduct farming data mining and accurate traceability in the next stage of the work. In particular, the system also adds poultry disease detection module supports to achieve the purpose of healthy farming. The research provides an information management plan for the intensive poultry farming model, and the designed management system may be the starting point of a future intelligent poultry farming management system based on cloud services and big data technology.
   Aiming at breaking down the bottleneck problems of different scale of poultry farms, the low profitability of poultry farming, and backward information management in China, a safe and efficient information management system for poultry farming was designed. This system consists of (1) a management system application layer, (2) a data service layer, and (3) an information sensing layer. The information sensing layer obtains and uploads production and farming information through the wireless sensor network built in the poultry house. The use of a cloud database as an information storage carrier in the data service layer eliminates the complex status of deploying local server clusters, and it improves the flexibility and scalability of the system. The management system application layer contains many sub-function modules including poultry disease detection functions to realize the visual management of farming information and health farming; each module operates independently and cooperates with each other to form a set of information management system for poultry farming with wide functional coverage, high service efficiency, safety, and convenience. The system prototype has been tested for the performance of wireless sensor network and cloud database, and the results show that the prototype is capable of acquiring and managing poultry farming information.

An early warning model applicable to this phase would represent a foundation for early warning systems for managing the disease and reducing pesticide usage. Based on the input parameters that were both readily available and appropriately limited in number, EWMPICDW (early warning model for primary infection of cucumber downy mildew in solar greenhouses) was developed based on monitoring data, early warning theory and plant disease epidemiology. The elaboration of this model included clarification of the meaning of warning, monitoring the warning indicators, forecasting the warning situation, tracing the warning sources and controlling the warning situation. The definition of warning included disease occurrence (yes or no) and probability. Because the leaf wetness duration (LWD) played an important role in disease warning systems for crops in solar greenhouses and was difficult to monitor, the leaf wetness sensor and RH threshold model were investigated and combined to form a practical estimation solution for LWD. Within the warning situation forecasting model system, the infection condition and incubation early warning submodels received the most attention. The infection condition early warning submodel was developed by using a threshold method based on the combination of LWD and mean temperature in LWD. The temperature was chosen as the warning indicator for incubation, and the incubation early warning submodel was defined using nonlinear regression methods. The warning sources traceability algorithm was developed in relation to expert knowledge and in terms of a mode of disaster mitigation that involved cutting the disaster chain from the headstream. The method for controlling the warning situation was based on good agricultural practices (GAP). The early warning model was implemented as a system and was evaluated using data for 4 years at two sites in Beijing, China. The warnings can be provided more than 2 d before symptoms appear. Using EWMPICDW. a positive early warning is associated with a change in the chance of disease occurrence from 0.68 to 0.96. Accordingly, the probability of disease occurrence calculated for the early warning model was 96%. These results demonstrate that the data-driven model will support the development of early warning systems for primary infection by cucumber downy mildew in solar greenhouses. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

   ANALYSIS
AB Fraudulent practices are the first and foremost concern of food industry, with significant consequences in economy and human's health. The increasing demand for food has led to food fraud by replacing, mixing, blending, and mislabeling products attempting to increase the profits of producers and companies. Consequently, there was the rise of a multidisciplinary field which encompasses a large number of analytical techniques aiming to trace and authenticate the origins of agricultural products, food and beverages. Among the analytical strategies have been developed for the authentication of geographical origin of foodstuff, Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) increasingly dominates the field as a robust, accurate, and highly sensitive technique for determining the inorganic elements in food substances. Inorganic elements are well known for evaluating the nutritional composition of food products while it has been shown that they are considered as possible tracers for authenticating the geographical origin. This is based on the fact that the inorganic component of identical food type originating from different territories varies due to the diversity of matrix composition. The present systematic literature review focusing on gathering the research has been done up-to-date on authenticating the geographical origin of agricultural products and foods by utilizing the ICP-MS technique. The first part of the article is a tutorial about food safety/control and the fundaments of ICP-MS technique, while in the second part the total research review is discussed.

AB Cold chain is one of the most important ways to guarantee the quality and safety of table grapes. It is necessary to monitoring the temperature in the whole cold chain process to keep the constant temperature and guarantee the quality and safety of table grapes in cold chain. This paper aims to develop a battery-free wireless sensor system with compressed sensing for the table grapes cold chain. The battery-free wireless sensor system was realized by using the ultra high frequency radio frequency identification (UHF RFID) on-chip temperature sensor with no battery. The temperature fluctuation performance of the table grapes in the cold chain, the compressed sensing (CS) performance of the temperature reconstructed error with the original data and the battery-free wireless sensor system with compressed sensing evaluation were comprehensively analyzed and discuss. The developed battery-free wireless sensor system with compressed sensing could effectively monitor the actual temperature with high reconstruction accuracy to save the data storage space, transmission and operation resources, improve the temperature transparency in cold chain, and finally ensure the quality and safety of table grapes. The developed battery-free wireless sensor system with compressed sensing could be extended for other cold chain applications to improve their transparency and transmission efficiency of the wireless monitoring. It is also possible to integrate the relative humidity, gas sensors into the battery-free wireless sensor system to monitor more environment parameters in cold chain.

AB Despite the expressed interest of Canadians in sustainable and comprehensively labelled seafood, the country's seafood labelling requirements remain scant and naming conventions in the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) 'fish list' allow the grouping of multiple species under single 'umbrella' terms. Here, we test the extent to which CFIA listings reflect current market availability and conceal biodiversity, using the flatfishes as a model. Accordingly, we compared CFIA-listed flatfish species with those documented in Canadian import records, those in production records of Canada and its flatfish suppliers, as well as those identified in DNA-based market surveys conducted across Canada. Of the 43 flatfish species on the CFIA list, only three have consistently shown up in Canadian imports, production records and market surveys, whereas almost a third (n = 15) failed to appear in any of the latter over at least a decade. Species have been detected on the market that are absent from this list, while overfished and/or threatened taxa have been found concealed under vague generic terms. The list's many superfluous inclusions, outdated names, missing species and poor correspondence with trading partner's naming conventions are inconsistent with the legal tenets of Canadian policy to uphold fair market practices and consumer choice, and instead result in a system inundated by numerous paths of misinterpretation, misclassification and substitution. Moreover, Canada's official flatfish trade statistics lack sufficient taxonomic granularity to elucidate all species involved and track flatfish trade flows. Illuminating these loopholes should compel improvements in Canadian seafood labelling and traceability legislative frameworks.

AB Monitoring of market products for detection of genetically modified organisms (GMO) is needed to comply with legislation in force in many regions of the world, to enforce traceability and to allow official control along the production and the distribution chains. This objective can be more easily achieved if reliable, time and cost-effective analytical methods are available. A GMO can be detected using either DNA-based or protein-based methods; both present advantages and disadvantages. The objective of this work was to assess the performance of a protein-based (lateral flow strips-LFT) and of a DNA-based (polymerase chain reaction-PCR) detection method for GMO analysis. One thousand five hundred samples of soybean, deriving from the sampling of 15 independent bulk lots in large shipments, were analysed to assess and compare the performance of the analytical methods and evaluate their suitability for GMO testing. Several indicators were used to compare the performance of the methods, including the percentage correlation between the PCR and LFT results. The GMO content of the samples ranged from 0 up to 100 %, allowing a full assessment of both analytical approaches with respect to all possible GMO content scenarios. The study revealed a very similar performance of the two methodologies, with low false-negative and false-positive results, and a very satisfactory capacity of both methods in detecting low amounts of target. While determining the fitness for purpose of both analytical approaches, this study also underlines the importance of alternative method characteristics, like costs and time.

AB This paper describes how the image processing technique known as template matching performs when used to recognize boards of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). Recognition of boards enables tracking of individual boards through an industrial process, which is vital for process optimization.
   A dataset of 886 Scots pine board images were used as a database to match against. The proposed board recognition method was evaluated by rescanning 44 of the boards and matching these to the larger dataset. Three different template matching algorithms have been investigated while reducing the pixel densities of the board images (downsampling the images). Furthermore, the effect of variations in board length has been tested and the computational speed of the recognition with respect to the database size has been measured. Tests were conducted using the open source software package OpenCV due to its highly optimized code which is essential for applications with high production speed.
   The conducted tests resulted in recognition rates above 99% for board lengths down to 1 m and pixel densities down to 0.06 pixels/mm. This study concluded that template matching is a good choice for recognition of wooden board surfaces. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and Aim: The multivariate discriminant (MVD) analysis was a successful statistical tool with a discriminatory capacity for tracing sheep breeds based on meat characteristics. Thus, this study aimed to identify three Saudi sheep breeds based on the physical and histochemical aspects of meat using MVD analysis.Materials and Methods: Eight male lambs from each breed, Najdi, Neami, and Harri, were selected randomly at 90 days of age and allocated into three groups for breeding in a completely randomized design. The feeding and rearing management were similar for an experimental period of 90 days. The experimental diet consisted of a concentrated mixture with identical amounts of calories and nitrogen. Fifty-one meat characteristics were measured in the preliminary MVD, representing hot and cold carcass weight, meat cuts and quality measures, body component weights, fat deposit weights, and histochemical characteristics.Results: Out of the total meat characteristics measured, only 19 characteristics had significant discriminant power. The most powerful characteristics were temperature, empty intestinal weight, pH24, external carcass length, heart weight, and L1, based on partial R-square and Wilks' lambda values. The phenotypic associations between the characteristics had strong associations. The obtained principal components efficiently classified the eight individuals of each breed into distinct groups using robust discriminant characteristics.Conclusion: This method allowed us to determine the breed of sheep carcasses and cuts by considering the physical characteristics of the meat. Therefore, butchers and consumers should use scientific techniques for assigning carcasses and meat to their sheep breed after slaughtering.

AB Huangjing (Polygonati Rhizoma) is a high-value homology of medicine and food in China, for which the geographical origins (i.e., geoherbalism) and farming patterns (natural or farmed) are decisive in its functions and selling price. In this study, five stable isotope ratios (delta 13C, delta 15N, delta 18O, delta 2H, and 87Sr/86Sr) and 48 multielement signatures of 238 Huangjing samples collected from seven main production areas in China were analyzed together for origin traceability and farming authentication purposes. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) for each variable revealed that delta 18O, delta 2H, 87Sr/86Sr, Fe, and rare earth elements were significantly different among origins. The orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) modeling of all variables indicated that K, Ca, Mg, Fe, and Mn were the most important variables (VIP > 1) for identifying Qingyang Huangjing protected geographical indication (PGI) from those of other origins, and discriminant accuracy reached 100 %. Moreover, ANOVA and OPLS-DA demonstrated that delta 15N, K, Ca, and Mg were the elements that effectively distinguished natural and farmed Huangjing. Therefore, the strategy may be an important alternative tool for authenticity management, which is significant for combating origin mislabeling and the fraudulent conducts of Huangjing products.

AB Introduction
   To maximize the performance of the target animal group, market-oriented feed production aims high-quality products by considering variability of ingredient quality attributes in the least cost formulations. Supply chain quality management systems reveal information that formulation can apply to achieve benefits.
   Materials and Methods
   Feed product had been formulated both with linear and stochastic programming on different probability levels with nutrient averages and the standard deviation of a key nutrient in ingredient batches from two vendors. The information sources of formulation were mapped, as well as the uses of output data.
   Results
   Data sources of formulation are internal (from feed manufacturer) and external (from vendors). Output data from formulation is mainly used internally, but available also for supply chain quality management. Formulation simulates the implications of raw material variability from suppliers and helps to identify areas of vendor development.
   Conclusion
   Formulation provides possibility to consider ingredient variability to reach product target on higher probability levels. Integration between supplier quality management and feed formulation brings the benefits of more consistent product quality, lower costs of rations, accuracy in planning, support in ingredient purchasing decisions, better traceability, improvement of supplier performance, and internal quality management processes.

AB Animal species identification in food and feed has gained increasing interest in recent years due to public health, economic and legal concerns. In the present work, a TaqMan real-time PCR assay targeting the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene was developed for detection of a specific DNA fragment (87 bp) common to the most economically important fish families in fish-derived ingredients used in feed formulations. Performance of the assay was evaluated against stringent acceptance criteria in terms of specificity and sensitivity. The TaqMan real-time fish-specific system proved to be highly sensitive, allowing the detection of 0.1 pg of fish DNA. The assay was successfully applied to the authentication of two types of real-world compound feeds: industrial farm animal feeds and commercial pet foods, allowing detection of small fish percentages in the samples. The quantitative potential of the real-time PCR assay was further performed, concluding that, although results were well reproducible under the experimental conditions tested, an accurate estimation of the target content in feeds is not feasible in practice. The reported methodology may be useful as a molecular analytical tool to support fisheries control and enforcement, as well as the verification of authenticity of fish and fish-derived products in the food and feed sectors.

AB Aim: To determine if stable isotope analysis is a viable tool for authenticating the geographical origin of seafood purchased from the market. The carbon and nitrogen isotope values of samples were analysed to determine if they differ according to their source.
   Methodology : One set of barramundi samples were purchased from three different markets and another set was obtained directly from a farm. Two sets of tiger prawn samples were obtained from the same markets as the barramundi. These samples were then analysed using isotope ratio mass spectrometry to determine their carbon and nitrogen isotopic values.
   Results : The barramundi samples showed significant differences between sources in both the delta C-13 (< 0.05) and delta N-15 (< 0.05) values. Similarly, the tiger prawn samples also showed significant differences between sources in the delta C-13 (< 0.05) and delta N-15 (p-value < 0.05) values.
   Interpretation : This pilot study successfully distinguished between barramundi samples and tiger prawns from different geographical locations. We recommend that further studies be conducted with a higher number of samples, and multiple sites from different geographic regions, and to account for factors influencing the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values. This study highlights the potential of isotopic analysis as a tool for policy makers and regulatory bodies to verify seafood provenance and enforce industry compliance for source labelling of seafood products.

AB Introduction. Consumption of Physalis fruits is quite recent and the products are poorly known among consumers. This plant has been known for a long time as an ornamental in Europe, for at least 200 years. Traceability is increasingly becoming important across the agri-food industry; however, at the present time, the traceability of this fruit is only documentary. In case of doubt or fraud, no standardized analysis can determine the geographical origin of the fruits. Materials and methods. In order to discover the relationship between the fungal communities of the fruit and their geographical origins, 28S rDNA-PCR-DGGE was used to analyze the variation in fungal communities in three species of Physalis fruit (Physalis ixocarpa Brot., Physalis pruinosa L. and Physalis peruviana L.) from Egypt, Uganda and Colombia. Results. Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprints of 28S ribosomal DNA (28S rDNA) analyzed by multivariate analysis could distinguish different fruit origins by their fungal communities. Conclusion. We propose the PCR-DGGE method as a new traceability tool which provides fruit in general, and Physalis in particular, with a unique barcode for each country by using 28S rDNA fingerprinting of fungi.

AB In this study, we established a multiplex polymerase chain reaction-denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (MPCR-DHPLC) method for rapid detection of the aquatic-associated pathogens Vibrio cholerae, V.parahaemolyticus, V.vulnificus, V.mimicus, V.alginolyticus and Listeria monocytogenes. Specific primer sets targeting the dnaJ gene of the Vibrio species and the hly gene of L.monocytogenes were used. We also defined the optimal primer concentrations to detect each Vibrio species. We used the MPCR-DHPLC method to identify target bacteria in aquatic products. Performance characteristics of the MPCR-DHPLC system showed that it is specific for six common pathogenic bacterial species and can be used for the practical detection of these pathogens in aquatic products. Furthermore, two practical applications of two environmental water samples were tested according to this method by MPCR-DHPLC, then the results of detection were consistent with conventional tests but faster. It showed that this method proved to be a fast, sensitive and specific tool for V.cholerae, V.parahaemolyticus, V.vulnificus, V.mimicus, V.alginolyticus and L.monocytogenes detection in a routine microbiological laboratory.
   Practical ApplicationsVarious bacterial species can be simultaneously detected with the same PCR reaction. A MPCR-DHPLC method of identification of various bacterial species was established. This method improves test efficiency and minimizes test time.

AB Food quality and safety issues occurred frequently in recent years, which have attracted more and more attention of social and international organizations. Considering the increased quality risk in the food supply chain, many researchers have applied various information technologies to develop real-time risk identification and traceability systems (RITSs) for preferable food safety guarantee. This paper presents an innovative approach by utilizing the deep-stacking network method for hazardous risk identification, which relies on massive multisource data monitored by the Internet of Things timely in the whole food supply chain. The aim of the proposed method is to help managers and operators in food enterprises to find accurate risk levels of food security in advance and to provide regulatory authorities and consumers with potential rules for better decision-making, thereby maintaining the safety and sustainability of food product supply. The verification experiments show that the proposed method has the best performance in terms of prediction accuracy up to 97.62%, meanwhile achieves the appropriate model parameters only up to 211.26 megabytes. Moreover, the case analysis is implemented to illustrate the outperforming performance of the proposed method in risk level identification. It can effectively enhance the RITS ability for assuring food supply chain security and attaining multiple cooperation between regulators, enterprises, and consumers.

AB Temperature monitoring, shelf-life visibility and Least Shelf-life First Out (LSFO) stock strategy are important contents in perishable food cold chain logistics for both cold chain managers and workers in order to reduce quality and economic losses. This paper illustrates a wireless sensor network (WSN) based integrated Cold Chain Shelf Life Decision Support System ((CSLDS)-S-2) designed for perishable food product cold chain management. The system is implemented based on the WSN and time temperature indicator (TTI) features. Compared with traditional cold chain management methods used before, the (CSLDS)-S-2 not only bridges the information gap which exists between different cold chain phase enterprises and provide a seamless information flow along the whole chain but also enables cold chain enterprises to predict perishable food's shelf-life and helps make a smart LSFO strategy to reduce the quality and economic loss. System test and evaluation shows that the infield radio transmission is reliable and the whole system meets most of the users' requirements raised in system analysis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Stakeholder satisfaction is a significant aspect of component-based product development. Satisfaction level of stakeholder varies due to diverse reviews and perspective about components functionalities. The reviews and perspective create ambiguities and misunderstanding during management of components requirement from specification to linking requirements that lead to product failures. The improper components management increases efforts and errors when component's stakeholders and development team is located in a globally distributed environment. The major issues of distributed component-based systems, are control, communication, coordination, and semantical analysis of different reviews and perspectives. As requirements of components is elicited and developed at different locations which created ambiguities and irrelevancy during components integration. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a framework to improve the management process of components requirement in a distributed environment. To reduce ambiguities and incompleteness among requirements, aspect based sentiment analysis has been utilized for each stakeholders' reviews and perceptive individually. On the other hand, to reduce involvement of stakeholder and efforts in components prioritization and linking processes, we adapted cased based reasoning method and decision tree-based classification of requirements, respectively. The performance of the proposed framework has been evaluated through an experimental approach in order to compare it with current practices i.e. Random selection and expert based. The findings described that the accuracy of component management in global development increases with proposed framework. Further, results show that there is an increase in product quality with decrease in irrelevancy and redundancy in stakeholders' aspects and priority.

AB Among the challenges of pig farming in today's competitive market, there is factor of the product traceability that ensures, among many points, animal welfare. Vocalization is a valuable tool to identify situations of stress in pigs, and it can be used in welfare records for traceability. The objective of this work was to identify stress in piglets using vocalization, calling this stress on three levels: no stress, moderate stress, and acute stress. An experiment was conducted on a commercial farm in the municipality of Holambra, Sao Paulo State, where vocalizations of twenty piglets were recorded during the castration procedure, and separated into two groups: without anesthesia and local anesthesia with lidocaine base. For the recording of acoustic signals, a unidirectional microphone was connected to a digital recorder, in which signals were digitized at a frequency of 44,100 Hz. For evaluation of sound signals, Praat (R) software was used, and different data mining algorithms were applied using Weka (R) software. The selection of attributes improved model accuracy, and the best attribute selection was used by applying Wrapper method, while the best classification algorithms were the k-NN and Naive Bayes. According to the results, it was possible to classify the level of stress in pigs through their vocalization.

AB In order to adapt tracking implants in grapevine to production practices, four rootstocks belonging to two common Vitis hybrids [V. berlandieri x V. riparia (420 A, Kober 5BB, 504) and V. berlandieri x V. rupestris (1103 Paulsen)] were tagged with radio frequency tags using the available methods: direct drilling of the pith from the distal cut of the rootstock or a "U" cut performed laterally on the rootstock below the grafting point. Tests were also combined with hot water treatments against phytoplasmas or applied to one-year-old grafted rootlings ready for transplantation in the vineyard to reduce tagging costs. In addition, novel health-compliant methodologies for ultra-high frequency (UHF) tagging were evaluated. To assess the effects of tag implantation in rootstocks, plant viability, functional vascular tissue area and tag reliability were calculated, as well as the effects of phytopathogenic fungi on wounds produced by tagging. The tagging procedure did not cause significant effects on viability and functional vascular tissue area. Tag reliability was set at more than 96%. Fungal infections caused less than 1% of infected vascular tissue area and tagging methods could be integrated with hot water treatments against phytoplasmas. Tracking implants were applied successfully to one-year-old rootlings that were ready for transplantation, even if tag reliability decreased. Novel semi-internal implants of UHF tags did not cause concerns about plant health but tags were exposed to environmental stress or fortuitous damage during farming practices.

AB Lycium spp. fruit (goji or wolfberry) has become more popular due to its public acceptance as a functional food or "super food/fruit". The aim of this study was to describe the influence of two different drying systems (air-thermal and freeze drying) on fresh and dried goji fruit nutraceutical traits and report on the level of potentially bioactive compounds and their effects on total fruit phytocomplex and antioxidant activity. Spectrophotometric and chromatographic methods coupled to multivariate analysis were performed on all the goji samples. In this research, goji fresh and dried fruits were identified as a source of compounds with potential health-promoting properties. The results of this study showed that freeze drying allowed to preserve most of the phytochemical characteristics of the fresh fruits, as phenolic acids (ferulic and ellagic acids) and vitamin C content. Moreover, polyphenols could be selected as biomarkers in order to distinguish different Lycium species or the same Lycium genotype from different geographical areas. This research emphasizes that an adequate evaluation of nutraceutical traits is necessary in order to select the higher-quality raw materials (cultivated varieties): as a cost-effective and efficient way to trace food, this study showed that HPLC fingerprint can be used to identify and track different raw materials (fresh fruits) and derived food products (dried fruits).

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss the evolution of the food traceability system in China, examine factors that affect consumers' perception of a food traceability system, and determine their willingness to pay for having the system.
   Design/methodology/approach - Beijing, one of the largest pork markets in urban China, was chosen and 400 consumers were randomly interviewed using questionnaires and finally a logistic model was employed to analyze consumers' willingness to pay for traceable pork.
   Findings - The authors found that consumers' perception of pork traceability system is subject to a comparatively low level. Purchasing of traceable pork is affected by gender, self-evaluation of health, awareness of the traceability system, concern about food safety, and the stochastic price willing to pay.
   Originality/value - The paper is the first to quantify Chinese consumers' valuation for traceable pork and it helps pork producers and marketers understand consumers' willingness to pay a small premium of 4.5 RMB/kg (0.7 USD) for traceable pork. This finding has imperative policy implications that could help the government deal with the high cost associated with the use of a pork traceability system.

AB High-value yak meat from Qinghai-Tibet Plateau was investigated using stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta H-2, delta O-18, delta N-15 and delta S-34) to identify attributes which could verify and protect its geographical origin. Supervised PLS-DA was applied to the isotope data to discriminate four geographical locations. delta C-13, delta H-2, and delta O-18 values showed significant differences according to origin while delta N-15 and delta S-34 values did not show any change across the different regions. Isotope values of different body tissues from the same animal showed no statistical difference for the five stable isotopes. In addition, the delta H-2 and delta O-18 values of defatted yak meat was highly correlated to farm altitude and associated drinking water. This yak meat traceability method is particularly useful to protect the Product of Geographical Indication (PGI) status of Gannan yak meat and verify the farming origin of yak meat sold in markets for food safety purposes, especially when excessive hormones, pesticides or heavy metals are found.

AB The recent advances in RFID offer vast opportunities for research, development and innovation in agriculture. The aim of this paper is to give readers a comprehensive view of current applications and new possibilities, but also explain the limitations and challenges of this technology.
   RFID has been used for years in animal identification and tracking, being a common practice in many farms. Also it has been used in the food chain for traceability control. The implementation of sensors in tags, make possible to monitor the cold chain of perishable food products and the development of new applications in fields like environmental monitoring, irrigation, specialty crops and farm machinery.
   However, it is not all advantages. There are also challenges and limitations that should be faced in the next years. The operation in harsh environments, with dirt, extreme temperatures; the huge volume of data that are difficult to manage; the need of longer reading ranges, due to the reduction of signal strength due to propagation in crop canopy; the behavior of the different frequencies, understanding what is the right one for each application; the diversity of the standards and the level of granularity are some of them.

AB Simple Summary The Facciuta goat originated from Valnerina, a geographic area in central Italy, including the adjacent parts of four regions: Umbria, Marche, Lazio, and Abruzzo. The aim of this study was to assess how useful microsatellite molecular markers are for the genetic discrimination of the local goat, Facciuta della Valnerina, compared with the two cosmopolitan breeds, Saanen and Camosciata delle Alpi, reared in the same geographic area. The results revealed a very clear separation between the local population (Facciuta della Valnerina) and the two reference goat breeds (Saanen and Camosciata delle Alpi). Furthermore, reducing the number of markers from 16 to 12 still allowed us to distinguish the local population, indicating that microsatellite markers are an inexpensive method to discriminate local livestock breeds. This could be a fast and inexpensive genomic tool to trace goat products and distinguish their origin.
   Abstract Italy holds important genetic resources of small ruminant breeds. By distinguishing goat breeds at the DNA level, certification of products from specific breeds can be valorized. The aim of this study was to establish the genetic identity of Facciuta della Valnerina, a local goat population of Italy, compared with the cosmopolitan breeds, Saanen and Camosciata delle Alpi, reared in the same geographic area. A total of 116 microsatellite alleles ranging from 4 to 13 were detected at 16 loci in the three goat populations/breeds. A total of 23 private alleles with frequencies lower than 0.3 were detected in the Facciuta della Valnerina population. The mean numbers of alleles were 6.67, 4.58, and 4.92 in Facciuta della Valnerina, Camosciata delle Alpi, and Saanen, respectively. The expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.20 to 0.86. Most loci were highly polymorphic and informative (polymorphic information content >= 0.50). Factorial correspondence analysis and principal components analysis revealed very clear separation between Facciuta della Valnerina and the two reference goat breeds. Reducing the number of markers from 16 to 12 (on the basis of polymorphic information content and the number of alleles) still allowed us to distinguish the local population, indicating that microsatellite markers are capable of discriminating local livestock breeds at a low cost.

AB Background: Jujube resources are abundant in China, and Shanxi Province in particular is one of the places where they originated. The most famous 6 geographical indication (GI) jujube species in Shanxi are often masqueraded by nonoriginal jujube species, which seriously undermines the brand image. However, the current national quality standards, which have simple indicators, cannot completely trace the botanical and geographical origin of GI jujubes. Compared with small biomolecules and genes, polysaccharides possess a complicated structure and are sensitive to their geographical location and botanical origin, and these characteristics are important for botanical and geographical traceability. Therefore, we selected the 6 most famous GI jujube species in Shanxi Province, measured and analyzed their crude polysaccharide characterizations, and then selected efficient tracing indicators.
   Results: The crude polysaccharides from 6 GI jujube species of Shanxi Province were tested with several parameters, including their purity (the content of polysaccharides), uronic acid content, M-w distribution, monosaccharide composition, functional groups and bonds. In the assays that measured purity and uronic acid content, the purity varied within a very narrow band (96-99%) and presented no negative or positive correlation with uronic acid content. In the experiment that measured the M-w distribution by HPGPC, five peaks (RT1, RT2, RT3, RT4, RT5) were almost observed in 6 jujube species, and the RT3 content (240-250 Da), which showed a significant correlation to the content of RT4 and RT5, exhibited significant differences among 6 jujube species (RSD = 1.28 > 1.00). The monosaccharide composition indicated that the polysaccharides from 6 jujube species were rich in glucose (55-75%), arabinose (10-15%) and galactose acid (10-20%), with small amounts of rhamnose, glucosamine hydrochloride, galactose, xylose, and mannose (less than 5%). The FT-IR spectrum showed that crude polysaccharides from six jujube species shared similar functional groups and chemical bonds.
   Conclusions: The results above indicated that in the 6 GI jujube species, both homogeneity and differences were observed in the M-w distribution of crude polysaccharides. First, five peaks (RT1, RT2, RT3, RT4, RT5), which represent the M-w of 186,646-285,262 Da (RT1), 4634-17,296 Da (RT2), 240-250 Da (RT3), 98-103 Da (RT4) and 57-64 Da (RT5), respectively, could be detected in all 6 jujube species. Second, the RT3 contents exhibited significant differences among the 6 jujube species (RSD = 1.28 > 1.00) and showed a significant correlation with RT4 and RT5. Therefore, the M-w distribution may be treated as a potential distinguishing indicator among the 6 jujube species.

AB In order to achieve better control performance within the facility environment, this paper proposes a distributed model predictive control method, aiming at increasing the control precision of actuators, reducing energy consumption and equipment loss at the same time. Regarding optimizing this facility environment model, it could be treated as a multiobjective optimization problem. Referring to the cooperative game theory, each objective is regarded as a gamer. Each gamer considers both its own interests and other gamers' interests to achieve a balanced result when cooperation is achieved. The simulation experiments illustrate that the proposed control method is able to adjust the parameters of the facility environment to a preset interval properly. Moreover, in this specific simulation environment, the proposed method achieves better performances than the single objective control method and traditional linear weighted multiobjective control method in most of the evaluation criteria.

AB Cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) is among the most important cash crops in tropical countries. The existing cacao genetic diversity represents a key resource to ensure the long-term sustainability of cacao cultivation but it remains vastly underused. The objective of this paper is to describe the current state of conservation and use of cacao genetic materials in six countries in South (Peru and Ecuador) and Central America (Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala). For each country, we reviewed the regulations for cacao genetic resources, we carried out a survey of 176 gene banks and nurseries, and we performed a review of breeding and selection programs. We found that all countries had poor systems of certification, verification and traceability. Gene banks conserved many local materials in Peru and Ecuador while they mainly conserved international clones in Central American countries. In all countries except Honduras, more than half of the gene banks did not have any characterization or evaluation data of the conserved materials. Although nurseries in all countries had fair productive capacities, varieties sold were unevenly characterized in Peru, Ecuador and Guatemala, and less than half of the nurseries provided technical assistance to farmers in Ecuador and El Salvador. Breeding and selection programs had not fully used the cacao diversity in these countries. Based on the results, we identified the strengths and weakness, as well as the most appropriate investment areas for each country. A better conservation and use of cacao genetic resources in Latin America would benefit not only these countries but also the whole cacao sector.

AB Olive oil and wine production have a worldwide economic impact. Their market reliability is under great concern because of the increasing number of fraud and adulteration attempts. The need for a traceability system in all its extension is crucial particularly for the cases of olive oils and wines with certified labels, in which only a limited number of olives and grapevine varieties, respectively, are allowed in a restricted well-defined geographical area. Molecular markers have been vastly applied to the food sector, and in particular High-Resolution DNA Melting technology has been successfully applied for olive oil and wine authentication, as part of the traceability system. In this review, the applications of HRM and their usefulness for this sector considering, Safety, Security and Authenticity will be reviewed. A broad overview of the HRM technique will be presented, focusing on the aspects that are crucial for its success, in particular the new generation of fluorescent dsDNA dyes used for amplicon detection and quantification, and the data analysis. A brief outlook on the olive oil and wine authenticity procedures, based on new DNA technology advances, and in which way this may influence the future establishment of a traceability system will be discussed.

AB Background Countries have long been making efforts by reducing greenhouse-gas emissions to mitigate climate change. In the agreements of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, involved countries have committed to reduction targets. However, carbon (C) sink and its involving processes by natural ecosystems remain difficult to quantify. Methods Using a transient traceability framework, we estimated country-level land C sink and its causing components by 2050 simulated by 12 Earth System Models involved in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) under RCP8.5. Results The top 20 countries with highest C sink have the potential to sequester 62 Pg C in total, among which, Russia, Canada, USA, China, and Brazil sequester the most. This C sink consists of four components: production-driven change, turnover-driven change, change in instantaneous C storage potential, and interaction between production-driven change and turnover-driven change. The four components account for 49.5%, 28.1%, 14.5%, and 7.9% of the land C sink, respectively. Conclusion The model-based estimates highlight that land C sink potentially offsets a substantial proportion of greenhouse-gas emissions, especially for countries where net primary production (NPP) likely increases substantially and inherent residence time elongates.

AB In view of its high economic value, cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) scientists are seeking technological innovations that increases production and improve quality of cacao beans. The objective of this study was to characterize the mineral (N, K, P, Ca, Mg, Si, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Cd, Ba) composition of cacao beans of clone PH-16 grown in different soil types (Argisols, Cambisols and Latosols) and cropping systems (Cacao Cabruca, Cacao x Erythrina and Cacao x Rubber). With the exception of nitrogen, K was the mineral element most accumulated by cacao beans of PH-16 clone. Potassium, Ca, P and Mg mineral content of dry cacao beans were positively correlated with each other and showed similarity in clusters of average contents in relationship to the different cropping sites. Silicon content in cacao beans is proportionately close to the content of macronutrients. Variations in the content of Mn, Fe, Zn, Cu, Cd and Ba in cacao beans were related to the cropping sites because these mineral elements did not show any significant correlations with each other. Barium contents observed in this study correspond to levels of other micronutrients. In four sites, Cd content was higher than the limit set by the European Union.

AB Bovine cysticercosis is a problem distributed worldwide that result in economic losses mainly due to the condemnation of infected carcasses. One of the difficulties in applying control measures is the identification of the source of infection, especially because cattle are typically acquired from multiple farms. Here, we tested the utility of an animal movement network constructed with data from a farm that acquires cattle from several other different farms to map the major contributors of cysticercosis propagation. Additionally, based on the results of the network analysis, we deployed a sanitary management and drug treatment scheme to decrease cysticercosis' occurrence in the farm. Six farms that had commercial trades were identified by the animal movement network and characterized as the main contributors to the occurrence of cysticercosis in the studied farm. The identification of farms with a putative risk of Taenia saginata infection using the animal movement network along with the proper sanitary management and drug treatment resulted in a gradual decrease in cysticercosis prevalence, from 25% in 2010 to 3.7% in 2011 and 1.8% in 2012. These results suggest that the animal movement network can contribute towards controlling bovine cysticercosis, thus minimizing economic losses and preventing human taeniasis.

AB With the development of Internet technology, especially the application of mobile Internet technology in people's daily lives, people's lifestyles and production methods have changed, and they have brought huge economic benefits to society. In order to improve the development quality of agricultural e-commerce and expand the integration model of e-commerce, the paper analyzes the development and changes of Internet technology in the agricultural industry chain from the source to operation, production, service, security, and sales and studies the production experience model iterative upgrade. At the same time, a blockchain-based agricultural product traceability system is proposed. The system has a good supervision effect. Once recorded on the blockchain ledger, all data cannot be changed, which plays a very good traceability role for agricultural e-commerce. Actual cases show that the integrated model of agricultural e-commerce based on blockchain technology can bring huge development potential to the e-commerce industry and can improve the security and traceability of agricultural e-commerce.

AB The centralized nature of the United States food production, processing and distribution system makes it difficult for small fruit and vegetable farmers to serve as suppliers to institutional foodservice operations (IFOs), such as schools and hospitals. Due to age, economic and/or health status, it is often the clients of these foodservice operations who would benefit from increasing their consumption of locally grown fruits and vegetables. Unfortunately, institutions are often limited in their resources and food preparation infrastructure, and lack market-based incentives to incorporate locally grown foods into their menus. This study identifies and suggests solutions to barriers that limit the ability of small fruit and vegetable farmers to serve as suppliers to IFOs. Data were collected through an extensive series of focus group meetings held with small-scale fruit and vegetable farmers in three South-Atlantic states. From these meetings, practical marketing considerations, such as payment terms, and processing, packaging and delivery requirements of supplying institutional foodservice buyers, were identified as obstacles to the efficient function of this market channel. Food safety challenges, including the related issues of obtaining (food) products liability insurance and food safety certifications, were also acknowledged among top concerns. A majority of the identified challenges were similar to those reported in other studies, but several were complicated by characteristics of farm production, limited food system infrastructure and marketing experiences in the study region. Several practical solutions to overcoming some of these marketing constraints are offered.

AB Assignment of individual cattle to a specific breed can often not rely on pedigree information. This is especially the case for local breeds for which the development of genomic assignment tools is required to allow individuals of unknown origin to be included to their herd books. A breed assignment model can be based on two specific stages: (a) the selection of breed-informative markers and (b) the assignment of individuals to a breed with a classification method. However, the performance of combination of methods used in these two stages has been rarely studied until now. In this study, the combination of 16 different SNP panels with four classification methods was developed on 562 reference genotypes from 12 cattle breeds. Based on their performances, best models were validated on three local breeds of interest. In cross-validation, 14 models had a global cross-validation accuracy higher than 90%, with a maximum of 98.22%. In validation, best models used 7,153 or 2,005 SNPs, based on a partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and assigned individuals to breeds based on nearest shrunken centroids. The average validation sensitivity of the first two best models for the three local breeds of interest were 98.33% and 97.5%. Moreover, results reported in this study suggest that further studies should consider the PLS-DA method when selecting breed-informative SNPs.

AB Simple Summary This work focuses on reviewing research works on antibiotic residues, evaluating antibiotics used in livestock production and their excretion in animal products and in environmental matrices such as water and soil worldwide, according to each of the variables used such as antibiotic family, name, concentration (% and mg/kg or ppm), country, and continent where the residue was found. The main antibiotics used worldwide and in animal production are sulfonamides, tetracyclines, quinolones, penicillin, and cephalosporins. The use of antibiotics in animal production are widely used for disease treatment, health protection, and as growth promoters. Common antibiotics used in veterinary medicine are excreted and eliminated through the sewage system, contaminating water and soil with negative effects on agricultural activities. This systematic review focuses on the trend of research works on antibiotic residues, evaluating antibiotics used in livestock production and their excretion in animal products and in environmental matrices such as water and soil. Our database was composed of 165 articles, reporting the concentration of antibiotic residues found in the environment, livestock (cow, sheep, pig, horse, chicken, rabbit, goat), aquatic and terrestrial animal tissues, animal products (milk and eggs), wastewater, and soil. The documents were obtained from Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Europe, and Oceania. A descriptive analysis of antibiotic residues found worldwide was analyzed according to each of the variables used such as antibiotic family, name, concentration (% and mg/kg or ppm), and country and continent where the residue was found. The descriptive analysis was carried out using the "describe" function of psych package and pirate plots were drawn. According to our study, the main antibiotics used worldwide in animal production are sulfonamides, tetracyclines, quinolones, penicillin, and cephalosporins. At present, despite the trends of increased regulations on the use of antibiotics worldwide, antibiotics are still utilized in food animal production, and are present in water and soil, then, there is still the misuse of antibiotics in many countries. We need to become aware that antibiotic contamination is a global problem, and we are challenged to reduce and improve their use.

AB Geographical traceability of seafood is a global concern for both consumers and importers. It is urgent to develop a scientific approach for identifying the geographic origin of seafood to combat labeling fraud. This study verified 14 mineral elements as a tracer for identify the geographic origin of scallops in Shandong Province of China. Multivariate data analysis and machine learning algorithm including linear discriminate analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) were used to evaluate their performance in terms of classification or predictive ability. Thirteen elements in scallop samples with different regions showed significant differences (p < 0.05), which proved that the elemental composition was an effective tool for distinguishing the origins of scallops. The overall discrimination accuracy and predictive accuracy obtained from the LDA, KNN, RF, and SVM analysis was over 98.96% and 97.78%, respectively. Among these models, LDA model was the most recommended for the origin identification of scallops based on its high discriminant accuracy rate (100%), cross-validated accuracy rate (100%), and predictive accuracy rate (100%). Present results indicated the feasibility of element fingerprints combined with multivariate data analysis and machine learning algorithm in authenticating the geographical origin of scallops in China.

AB The diversity found among the Vitis vinifera L. species allows the production of wines with very different characteristics. The development of platforms suitable for food composition analysis is currently an emerging area. Among these, DNA biosensors have been developed for a wide variety of applications, ranging from food safety to authenticity. The main aim of this work was to study the detection capacity of the DNA-based optical biosensor using different V. vinifera matrices (leaf, must and wine). Genomic DNA was extracted from leaf, must and wine of three V. vinifera varieties and was tested on the long-period grating (LPG) DNA-based biosensor developed within our group. The biosensor was able to distinguish the varieties even using DNA extracted from complex matrices, revealing its potential to be applied in wine authenticity.

AB Lonicera caerulea is a honeysuckle plant with a long development history. It is defined as a "homology of medicine and food" fruit because it is rich in bioactive substances. By-products (such as pomace, leaves, stems, and flowers), which also have beneficial values, will be produced during processing. Nevertheless, the reuse of derivatives and the further development of new products of Lonicera caerulea are still a challenge. Firstly, this paper traced the development history of Lonicera caerulea and summarized its primary nutrients and bioactive substances, subsequently discussed the research progress and underlying molecular mechanisms of its functional properties, and introduced the application and potential of Lonicera caerulea in the fields of food, health products, cosmetics, medicine, and materials. Finally, this paper put forward the future research direction to promote the development of the Lonicera caerulea industry. To sum up, Lonicera caerulea, as a potential raw material, can be used to produce more functional products. Besides, more in-depth clinical trials are needed to clarify the specific molecular mechanism of the practical components of Lonicera caerulea and improve the rate of development and utilization.

AB A culture independent method based on qPCR was developed for the detection and quantification of two fungal inoculants in soil. The aim was to adapt a genotyping approach based on SSR (Simple Sequence Repeat) marker to a discriminating tracing of two different species of bioinoculants in soil, after their in-field release. Two entomopathogenic fungi, Beauveria bassiana and B. brongniartii, were traced and quantified in soil samples obtained from field trials. These two fungal species were used as biological agents in Poland to control Melolontha melolontha (European cockchafer), whose larvae live in soil menacing horticultural crops. Specificity of SSR markers was verified using controls consisting of: i) soil samples containing fungal spores of B. bassiana and B. brongniartii in known dilutions; ii) the DNA of the fungal microorganisms; iii) soil samples singly inoculated with each fungus species. An initial evaluation of the protocol was performed with analyses of soil DNA and mycelial DNA. Further, the simultaneous detection and quantification of B. bassiana and B. brongniartii in soil was achieved in field samples after application of the bio-inoculants. The protocol can be considered as a relatively low cost solution for the detection, identification and traceability of fungal bio-inoculants in soil.

AB The demand of honey with defined quality has increased around the world; therefore, an adequate description of the traceability and authenticity of honeys is necessary. The pollen and physicochemical characteristics of 58 honey samples collected from five different environmental units (EUs) of the Jujuy province (Argentine) were determined, in order to differentiate them by geographical origin through the application of chemometric methods. A qualitative pollen analysis was performed by microscopy. The physicochemical characteristics were determined by Association of Official Analytical Chemists methods. Correspondence analysis (CA), principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were performed. Forty-five per cent of honeys were monofloral; nearly half of them correspond to native speciesamong which, Salix humboldtiana, Baccharis sp. and Ziziphus mistol stood out. Physicochemical and microbiological analysis showed acceptable quality for honeys. CA characterized significantly honeys from four different EUs using all pollen data. While forward stepwise coupled to LDA identified 14 significant variables to build a discriminatory model with three significant discriminant functions, a cumulative variance of 94% was reached. Thus, 86% of the samples were correctly classified. PCA and LDA applied to physicochemical data allowed to distinguish three different groups with a significant function (p<0.01) that explained 90% of the total variability. Honey corresponding to EU III Subandean Hills of Santa Barbara was the most accurately classified by pollen and physicochemical data. The application of chemometric methods to pollen data and physicochemical parameters may be a useful tool to determine honey geographical origin. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper aims to establish a crop trait information acquisition system by combining barcode and radio frequency-based electronic identification (RFID) and near-field communication (NFC) technology applications. The system was devised to ensure (a) correct identification of each crop material and plot, (b) quick query and positioning for information collection, (c) correct combination of crop phenotypic data and images, and (d) reliable recording of periodic crop trait data with dependable transmission to the main server. This system, with multitag-based identification technology, was developed on an Android platform using the Java language. A type of RFID/NFC tag with a high-frequency chip was applied in the core, and a quick response (QR) code was used on the surface for material identification. A smartphone with NFC function can be used as an RFID reader, and its built-in camera can be used to decode QR codes. The system was used in some seed industries' commercial breeding and in national crop variety regional trial, with its functions including reading/writing of RFID/NFC tags, decoding QR codes, acquiring crop trait information, creating field maps, and uploading data. This system provided a low-cost and highly efficient solution for crop trait information collection. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Given that the consumption of pure varieties for Paridis Rhizome was increasing and causing a "ripple effect", i.e. numerous other unofficial Paris species were harvested and traded as the succedaneum of Paridis. The purpose of this study was to establish an effective strategy to distinguish Paris species and trace geographical origins of pure varieties of Paridis samples. A total of 87 batch samples of wild Paris were analyzed by UPLC and FTIR. Among them, 79 batch samples of five species and 40 batch samples of Paris polyphylla Smith var. yunnanensis (Franch.) Hand.-Mazz were used to establish pattern recognition models of PLS-DA, SVM and random forest simultaneously, basing on polyphyllin content, FTIR spectra, UPLC chromatograms, low- and mid-level data fusion strategy. Quantitative analysis results revealed that more obvious fluctuation of polyphyllin content was shown in different species sample than that of pure varieties of Paridis collected from various origins. Pattern recognition models showed that compared with polyphyllin content, FTIR spectra, UPLC chromatograms and low-level data fusion method, mid-level data fusion strategy showed a better accuracy (> 92%) in PLS-DA model to classify Paridis samples according to botanical and geographical origins. Similar results were obtained in SVM and random forest models. Thus, the classification of these three pattern recognition models were verified each other and demonstrated that mid-level data fusion strategy combined with chemometrics could recognize different Paris species and trace the pure varieties of Paridis geographical origins, correctly.

AB Animal species identification of milk and dairy products has received increasing attention concerning food composition, traceability, allergic pathologies and accurate consumer information. Here we sought to develop an easy to use and robust method for species identification in cheese with emphasis on an authenticity control of PDO Feta cheese products. We used specific mitochondrial DNA regions coupled with high resolution melting (HRM) a closed-tube method allowing us to detect bovine, ovine and caprine species and authenticate Greek PDO Feta cheese. The primers successfully amplified DNA isolated from milk and cheese and showed a high degree of specificity. HRM was proven capable of accurately identifying the presence of bovine milk (not allowed in Feta) down to 0.1% and also of quantifying the ratio of sheep to goat milk mixture in different Feta cheese commercial products. In conclusion, HRM analysis can be a faster, with higher resolution and a more cost effective alternative method to authenticate milk and dairy products including PDO Feta cheese and to quantitatively detect its sheep milk adulterations.

AB Traceability of milk origin in China is conducive to the implementation of the protection of regional products. In order to distinguish milk from different geographical distances in China, we traced the milk of eight farms in four neighboring provinces of China (Inner Mongolia autonomous region, Hebei, Ningxia Hui autonomous and Shaanxi), and multivariate data analysis was applied to the data including elemental analysis, stable isotope analysis and fatty acid analysis. In addition, orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) is used to determine the optimal classification model, and it is explored whether the combination of different technologies is better than a single technical analysis. It was confirmed that in the inter-provincial samples, the combination of the two techniques was better than the analysis using a single technique (fatty acids: R-2 = 0.716, Q(2) = 0.614; fatty acid-binding isotopes: R-2 = 0.760, Q(2) = 0.635). At the same time, milk produced by farms with different distances of less than 11 km in each province was discriminated, and the discriminant distance was successfully reduced to 0.7 km (Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region: the distance between the two farms was 0.7 km, R-2 = 0.771, Q(2) = 0.631). For short-distance samples, the combination multiple technologies are not completely superior to a single technique, and sometimes, it is easy to cause model over-fitting.

AB Food safety systems that implement Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), certification, traceability, brands as well as in geographical indications and private branding require dedicated investments in physical resources, human resources and in re-organising the production processes and control activities. Investment decisions can be made according to legal requirements or based on voluntary decisions. In this study, we address the two following research questions: do the inducements due to the regulatory framework influence the decision to invest in the implementation of food safety strategies and what is the size of this potential influence? Does the allocation of the decision right to invest influence the investment decision and does this potential influence vary across food safety systems? We carried out an empirical investigation on investment decisions in the Italian meat sector, comparing systems dedicated to safety and marketing strategies. The knowledge of such an influence provides a better understanding of the micro-level motivations of food safety investments in a critical area and contribute to the design of regulatory strategies.

AB Background: Ruminant feed containing animal byproduct proteins (ABPs) is prohibited in many countries due to its risk of transmitting prion diseases (PD). In most cases the entire herd is sacrificed, which causes great harm to the producer countries by preventing their exportation of ruminant derived-products.
   Methods: We used stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) of carbon (C-13/C-12) and nitrogen (N-15/N-14) to trace the animal protein in the blood of 15 buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) divided into three experimental groups: 1 - received only vegetable protein (VP) during 117 days; 2 - received animal and vegetable protein (AVP); and 3 - received animal and vegetable protein with animal protein subsequently removed (AVPR). Groups 2 and 3 received diets containing 13.7% bovine meat and bone meal (MBM) added to a vegetable diet (from days 21-117 in the AVP group and until day 47 in the AVPR group, when MBM was removed).
   Results: On the 36th day, differences were detectable in the feeding profile (p < 0.01) among the three experimental groups, which remained for a further 49 days (85th day). The AVPR group showed isotopic rate reversibility on the 110th day by presenting values similar to those in the control group (VP) (p > 0.05), indicating that it took 63 days to eliminate MBM in this group. Total atoms exchange (> 95%) of C-13 and N-15 was observed through incorporation of the diet into the AVP and AVPR groups.
   Conclusions: IRMS is an accurate and sensitive technique for tracing the feeding profile of ruminants through blood analysis, thus enabling investigation of ABP use.

AB A high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MS/MS) method for the floral origin traceability of chaste honey and rape honey samples was firstly presented in this study. Kaempferol, mono and ferulic acid were used as floral markers to distinguish chaste honey from rape honey. Chromatographic fingerprinting at 270 nm and 360 nm could be used to characterise chaste honey and rape honey according to the analytical profiles. Principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares (PLS), partial least squares-discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) and soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) were applied to classify the honey samples according to their floral origins. The results showed that chaste honey and rape honey could be successfully classified by their floral sources with the analytical methods developed through this study and could be considered encouraging and promising for the honey traceability from unifloral or multifloral nectariferous sources.

AB The study describes significant outcomes of the Metrology for Meteorology' project, MeteoMet, which is an attempt to bridge the meteorological and metrological communities. The concept of traceability, an idea used in both fields but with a subtle difference in meaning, is at the heart of the project. For meteorology, a traceable measurement is the one that can be traced back to a particular instrument, time and location. From a metrological perspective, traceability further implies that the measurement can be traced back to a primary realization of the quantity being measured in terms of the base units of the International System of Units, the SI. These two perspectives reflect long-standing differences in culture and practice and this project - and this study - represents only the first step towards better communication between the two communities. The 3 year MeteoMet project was funded by the European Metrology Research Program (EMRP) and involved 18 European National Metrological Institutes, 3 universities and 35 collaborating stakeholders including national meteorology organizations, research institutes, universities, associations and instrument companies. The project brought a metrological perspective to several long-standing measurement problems in meteorology and climatology, varying from conventional ground-based measurements to those made in the upper atmosphere. It included development and testing of novel instrumentation as well as improved calibration procedures and facilities, instrument intercomparison under realistic conditions and best practice dissemination. Additionally, the validation of historical temperature data series with respect to measurement uncertainties and a methodology for recalculation of the values were included.

AB Energy consumption is one of the most crucial issues in the table grapes supply chain. However, the potential for energy conservation assessment is still limited because of the complexity of the process. The aim of this paper is to propose an energy conservation potential assessment method in order to increase energy consumption transparency and help managers take appropriate energy conservation measures to reduce the energy consumption in the table grapes supply chain. The conservation potential assessment in three kinds of the supply chain modes (the normal chain, the cold insulation chain and the cold chain), were realized by integrating the actual energy consumption investigated with the unified energy consumption per unit energy factor that represents the energy consumption throughout the entire product lifecycle. According to the comprehensive analysis of the energy consumption compared with the energy conservation potential in actual supply chain of table grapes, the proposed energy conservation potential assessment method could provide a unified method for evaluating the energy conservation potential in different supply chain mode of table grapes. The energy conversation potential in cold insulation chain, which was about 0.985, was the highest and that in cold chain, which was about 0.935, was the smallest. However, the cold chain was still the optimal supply chain for the table grapes because of the characteristics of the longest storage shelf life and the lowest quality decay, and the cold chain energy consumption would be further reduced by adopting the more advanced refrigeration and preservation technologies. The proposed energy conservation potential assessment method could be extended for other supply chain applications to evaluate their own energy conservation potential, and thus, reduce their energy consumption.

AB Forecasting models are useful tools to predict and manage epidemiological grapevine infection such as downy mildew (Plasmopara viticola). These models have improved the quality of the output data, but none of them considered the quality of the input data in terms of evaluation of measurement uncertainty and traceability of the sensors of the weather conditions measuring system. Air temperature and relative humidity sensors used in this study have been calibrated by means of the transportable climatic chamber developed by INRiM, directly traceable to reference sensor, a Capsule type Standard Platinum Resistance Thermometer calibrated at the fixed points of the ITS_90 scale. The outcomes data collected during 2011 and 2012, with inclusion of measurement uncertainties, were used as a input values for the simulation by employing the EPI model. The simulations with inclusion of measurement uncertainty foresee with better accuracy the period of infection and the moment to make treatments in the vineyard respect the simulation without inclusion of uncertainty, up to 7 days. In this study the meteorological observations in field have been improved by applying a metrological approach and calibration methods for automatic weather stations in homogeneous agricultural sites.

AB Due to the rapid increase in environmental degradation and depletion of natural resources, the focus of researchers is shifted from economic to socio-environmental problems. Blockchain is a disruptive technology that has the potential to restructure the entire supply chain for sustainable practices. Blockchain is a distributed ledger that provides a digital database for recording all the transactions of the supply chain. The main purpose of this research is to explore the literature relevant to blockchain for sustainable supply chain management. The focus of this review is on the sustainability of the blockchain-based supply chain concerning environmental conservation, social equality, and governance effectiveness. Using a systematic literature review, a total of 136 articles were evaluated and categorized according to the triple bottom-line aspects of sustainability. Challenges and barriers during blockchain adoption in different industrial sectors such as aviation, shipping, agriculture and food, manufacturing, automotive, pharmaceutical, and textile industries were critically examined. This study has not only explored the economic, environmental, and social impacts of blockchain but also highlighted the emerging trends in a circular supply chain with current developments of advanced technologies along with their critical success factors. Furthermore, research areas and gaps in the existing research are discussed, and future research directions are suggested. The findings of this study show that blockchain has the potential to revolutionize the entire supply chain from a sustainability perspective. Blockchain will not only improve the economic sustainability of the supply chain through effective traceability, enhanced visibility through information sharing, transparency in processes, and decentralization of the entire structure but also will help in achieving environmental and social sustainability through resource efficiency, accountability, smart contracts, trust development, and fraud prevention. The study will be helpful for managers and practitioners to understand the procedure of blockchain adoption and to increase the probability of its successful implementation to develop a sustainable supply chain network.

AB Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems are widely used in production livestock systems for identification, traceability assurance, and animal registration. An RFID system was implemented and evaluated for use in a four-compartment, two-tier, environmental preference chamber (EPC) to detect hens transiting between compartments. Eight RFID antennae were located near the passages between compartments and each hen wore an RFID tag on one of its legs. The RFID system's performance was assessed by determining detection ranges in a controlled test and by comparing the number of entries into and duration in each compartment as detected by the RFID system to manual assessment of recorded video. The RFID system detection range was revealed to cover a radius of approximately 29 cm from the antenna, excluding a portion of the compartment furthest from the antenna. During a choice-test study, successful detection rates based on duration of stay in compartments were 91.0 +/- 2.6% (mean +/- SD) for trials with groups of birds, and 85.8 +/- 8.0% for trials with individual birds. Based on number of entries into compartments, successful detection rates were 62.6 +/- 11.2% for trials with groups of four birds, and 51.3 +/- 18.4% for trials with individual birds. Sources of entry misdetection included: (i) RFID tag being out of the detection range during sampling; (ii) conflicts caused by multiple RFID tags within the same detection zone; and (iii) visits of duration less than the RFID antenna scan interval. The delay between hen entry and RFID system detection averaged 42.3 +/- 35.7 s and 6.4 +/- 5.2 s in trials with individuals and with groups, respectively. Detection times were within the antenna scanning interval of 15 s (a hen entered a compartment and was immediately detected by the next antenna scan) in 60.3% of the events with individuals and 98.1% of the events with groups. Despite the difference between detected and actual entries (P=0.008 [groups]; P = 0.05 [individuals 1) no significant differences were found between total duration of compartment occupancy over a 24 h test period or average compartment visit duration, as calculated from RFID data and video observations. The RFID system was suitable for characterizing the amount of time birds spent in each EPC compartment, but not reliable for determining number of entries into a compartment.

AB The wine sector is one of the most economically important agro-food businesses. The wine market value is largely associated to terroir, in some cases resulting in highly expensive wines that attract fraudulent practices. The existent wine traceability system has some limitations that can be overcome with the development of new technological approaches that can tackle this problem with several means. This review aims to call attention to the problem and to present several strategies that can assure a more reliable and authentic wine system, identifying existent technologies developed for the sector, which can be incorporated into the current traceability system.

AB The possibility to authenticate food products is crucial to defend local livestock production chains from frauds. Cinta Senese is an autochthonous pig breed reared under extensive or semi-extensive management systems, mainly in the Tuscany (Italy). A Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) brand for Cinta Senese meat was recently obtained. The breed is characterised by a typical black with a white-belted coat colour pattern. We analysed a coat colour gene (KIT) to identify a DNA marker that could be useful for Cinta Senese meat product authentication. An informative single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was identified among different KIT gene haplotypes that were obtained from several pigs of different breeds. This SNP (g.43597545C > T; position on porcine chromosome 8 in the Sscrofa10.2 genome assembly) was genotyped by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) in 631 animals of 11 different pig breeds and one wild boar population. Allele T was almost fixed in Cinta Senese (95.9%) and absent in many breeds and was considered the tag SNP of the belted allele. Probability to correctly assign an unknown meat sample to Cinta Senese was 0.97-1.00. This DNA marker can be useful to distinguish meat of Cinta Senese pigs from meat of non-belted pigs. Thus, it could be an important tool not only to defend Cinta Senese pork chain from frauds but also to design breeding plans to eliminate non belted alleles from this pig population.

AB This chapter portrays the information flow for sustainability issues along the globalized food supply chain and explores the eco-certification decisions of farm businesses, viewing them as the first upstream chain participant. This examination is based on the literature to connect eco-certification with transparency and to portray traceability schemes for sustainability issues in food supply chains, followed by information technology-based systems and applications supporting traceability. The third section presents the eco-certification decisions at the supply chain level in four subsections. It first builds a theoretical framework regarding the downstream firms' sustainability-related decisions by offering conceptual definitions. Next the farm business decision logic is given, followed by the discrete choice model. The specialization of the model is presented in the third subsection, followed by the results, discussions, and implications for practitioners. Some conclusions and implications for future research are offered in the last section.

DE Beef cattle identification; Muzzle pattern; SIFT; Matching refinement
ID RECOGNITION
AB Beef cattle identification in a livestock management framework is an important issue. It is related to registration and traceability which are very important for breeding, production and distribution of the beef cattle. The muzzle pattern as a mean of identification has been studied since 1921 and several papers have proven that it can be used in the case of the cattle identification. The muzzle pattern has characteristic like the human's fingerprint. In this study, the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) approach has been evaluated for the identification purpose based on biometrics and compared with methods from the previous two research papers. The numbers of matched-keypoints have been defined as the matching score. The matching refinement technique based on the keypoint's orientation information has been proposed to eliminate the miss-matched keypoints so that the identification performance is increased. Based on the experimental results which use data consisting of 160 muzzle pattern images from 20 individuals, the original SIFT approach has had the best performance compared to the previous methods with the value of the Equal Error Rate (EER) being equal to 0.0167. The proposed matching refinement technique has successfully reduced the false matching so that the value of the EER has been decreased to 0.0028. The SIFT approach and the proposed matching refinement technique can be a potential method for the beef cattle identification based on the image of the muzzle pattern lifted on paper.

AB European consumers are more and more aware of the credence attributes of foods, particularly of those of animal origin. The aim of the paper was to assess whether the information about production system may modify the consumer liking of cheese. Montasio PDOcheese (MC), usually made by milk from indoor reared cows of different breeds, was processed from pure milk of Italian Simmental (IS) cows (ISMC) or of IS cows grazing on mountain pasture (ALP-ISMC). A consumer test was carried out in two sessions on 60-d ripened cheeses. In the first, both cheeses were tasted by Montasio consumers in blind condition (Perceived liking, PL). Then the respondents were asked to read information about the breed and the rearing system and to give their Expected liking (EL). Two weeks after, in the second session, the same consumers tasted the two cheeses with the linked information (Actual liking, AL). Despite the similar PL average score (ISMC: 21 +/- 2.3 vs. ALP-ISMC: 23 +/- 2.2 points on Labelled Affective Magnitude scale, P> 0.05), it was possible to identifying consumers' clusters with differential liking for the two types of Montasio PDO, that were characterised by different physicochemical properties. Consumers express a high EL for ISMC (38 +/- 2.6 points) and even more for ALPISMC (61 +/- 2.5 points). The AL of ISMC (35 +/- 2.1 points) was similar and statistically not different from the EL (complete assimilation of information about breed). For ALP-ISMC the assimilation was complete for consumers (29%) who have expressed a positive PL for it, at least twice as much than ISMC. For the rest of consumers, both information and intrinsic properties play a significant role in the AL of the pasture-derived cheese.

AB The growing concern for food safety and quality motivates governments and private sectors to improve consumers' confidence in food systems, such as through adopting certifications and traceability systems. The recent emergence of diverse food labelling schemes and the turbulence in food systems in emerging countries have sparked questions about consumers' valuation of such labels. Nonetheless, little is known on how the familiarity with, trust in and knowledge of these food labelling schemes affect consumers' willingness to pay for labelling schemes in emerging market contexts. This study aims to address these literature gaps by investigating consumers' valuation of existing certifications, branding and traceability labelling schemes in Vietnam. A face-to-face survey was conducted, including a discrete choice experiment on water spinach in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The findings indicated that Vietnamese consumers are generally willing to pay price premia for food labelling schemes, such as VietGAP certification, EU and USDA organic certifications, private branding and traceable Quick Response (QR) coding. While familiarity and understanding had no significant impact on Vietnamese consumers' valuation, trust was found to be a critical factor shaping willingness to pay for products bearing VietGAP label. Policy implications and marketing strategies for organic certifications and traceability schemes in Vietnam are discussed.

AB Objective: Aim of present study was the set up of a fast and reliable protocol using species-specific markers for the quali-quantitative analysis of DNA and the detection of ruminant biological components in dairy products. For this purpose, the promoter of the gene coding for the alpha-lactoalbumin (LALBA) was chosen as possible candidate for the presence of short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs).
   Methods: DNA was isolated from somatic cells of 120 individual milk samples of cattle (30), Mediterranean river buffalo (30), goat (30), and sheep (30) and the gene promoter region (about 600/700 bp) of LALBA (from about 600 bp upstream of exon 1) has been sequenced. For the development of a single polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol that allows the simultaneous identification of DNA from the four species of ruminants, the following internal primers pair were used: 5'-CACTGATCTTAAAGCTCAGGTT-3' (forward) and 5'-TCAGA GTAGGCCACAGAAG-3' (reverse).
   Results: Sequencing results of LALBA gene promoter region confirmed the presence of SINEs as monomorphic "within" and variable in size "among" the selected species. Amplicon lengths were 582 bp in cattle, 592 bp in buffalo, 655 in goat and 729 bp in sheep. PCR specificity was demonstrated by the detection of trace amounts of species-specific DNA from mixed sources (0.25 ng/mu L).
   Conclusion: We developed a rapid PCR protocol for the quali-quantitative analysis of DNA and the traceability of dairy products using a species-specific marker with only one pair of primers. Our results validate the proposed technique as a suitable tool for a simple and inexpensive (economic) detection of animal origin components in foodstuffs.

AB The use of mass spectrometry is currently widespread in polyphenol research because of its sensitivity and selectivity, but its usual high cost, reduced robustness, and nonavailability in many analytical laboratories considerably hinder its routine implementation. Herein, we describe the optimization and validation of a high-throughput, wide-coverage, and robust metabolomics method based on reversed-phase ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection for the identification and quantification of 69 phenolic compounds and related metabolites covering a broad chemical space of the characteristic secondary metabolome of plant foods. The method was satisfactorily validated following the Food and Drug Administration guidelines in terms of linearity (4-5 orders of magnitude), limits of quantification (0.007-3.6 mg L-1), matrix effect (60.5-124.4%), accuracy (63.4-126.7%), intraday precision (0.1-9.6%), interday precision (0.6-13.7%), specificity, and carryover. Then, it was successfully applied to characterize the phenolic fingerprints of diverse food products (i.e., olive oil, red wine, strawberry) and biological samples (i.e., urine), enabling not only the detection of many of the target compounds but also the semi-quantification of other phenolic metabolites tentatively identified based on their characteristic absorption spectra. Therefore, this method represents one step further toward time-efficient and low-cost polyphenol fingerprinting, with suitable applicability in the food industry to ensure food quality, safety, authenticity, and traceability.

AB Farm animals raised under free-range (FR) systems are assumed to have improved welfare and higher-quality products that are better to eat than intensively reared animals. However, the modulations are limited in scientific investigations. In this study, we compared 2 rearing systems (FR and cage) and their effects on chickens, including production performance, product quality, body condition, physiological indicators, and gene expression. By using a match-mismatch design in which each treatment was transferred to the other treatment during the last period of the experiment, we aimed to understand the influence of current and former rearing conditions and the ability of individuals to adapt to the current environment. The results indicated that the FR system led to better chicken welfare (e.g., gait score, feather condition, and physiological indicators, P < 0.05) and contributed to higher product quality (P < 0.05), although it resulted in poorer production performance (P < 0.05) and foot pad condition (P < 0.05) than that of the cage rearing system. Additionally, the FR system triggered a series of inner changes and genetic responses in chickens, such as the upregulation of calcium and GnRH signaling, actin and cytoskeleton regulations, immune functions, and developmental processes, and the downregulation of pathological regulations (q-value < 0.05 for all gene ontology terms and P < 0.05 for all Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways). In conclusion, rearing systems alter chicken gene expression patterns, which provide a genetic basis for the adaptability to rearing environments and ultimately affects chicken welfare and products.

AB GSD is a Global software development environment where data are distributed to more than two sites. These sites may be located on national or continental borders. Every year it expands its development volume, which has become a trend for the software development business. Because of increasing demand, it has become a common type of business. The value of offshore software development has increased immensely. According to the recent predictions, one-quarter of US software-related business shifts offshore, including integration and management-related services. GSD helps explore resources from other countries, increasing knowledge and enhancing operational efficiency. Therefore, globalization has changed the development nature of software. Different organizations face several challenges, such as coordination and requirement ambiguity, during the change management process in GSD. Traceability accommodates these changes in forward and backward direction. However, it gives rise to several challenges like less client involvement because of its distributed nature and challenging to manage the requirement ambiguity due to increased cost. Therefore, the Flexible Framework for Requirement Management (FFRM) must handle the abovementioned issues.

AB Traceability of foods has become very important problem respect to food quality and typicalness of foods. Cheeses' milk origin cannot be identified by the consumer and they are sold at different prices under various product names. Recently, this has caused the problem of 'adulteration'. The aim of this study is to determine the amount and origin of milk used in cheese production by using real-time PCR which has been used for identification of animal species in dairy products. In this study, 90 different cheeses offered for sale in Turkey of 30 brands from various sources such as cow, sheep and goat have been studied. At the end of the study, only 36.67% of samples were determined to be produced from 100% cow milk. In the remaining 1333%, a mixture of goat and sheep milk have been found. Only one sample of sheep cheese was produced from 100% sheep milk. In goat cheese samples, 16.67% of cheese was produced from 100% sheep milk and the origin of only 10% was identified as 100% cow milk. No linear relationship could be determined between chemical composition, fatty acids ratios and amount and origin of cheeses (P < 0.05). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has been extensively used to date for the analysis of olive oil samples and constitutes a valuable tool particularly for the study of the triacylglycerol fraction, which is the major fraction of olive oils. In this report, we demonstrate the usefulness of one-dimensional NMR spectroscopy (H-1 and C-13 NMR) for the non-destructive analysis of the triacylglycerol fraction of olive oils. To achieve this goal, C-13 spectral editing technique known as distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT), namely C-13 NMR DEPT 45, C-13 NMR DEPT 90, C-13 NMR DEPT 135 was used for the analysis of the triacylglycerol fraction of the olive oil sample owing to the simplification on peak assignments of C-13 spectra. The suitability and usefulness of those DEPT experiments using different angle values in only one pulse sequence will be explored on the interpretation of C-13 NMR spectra. In overall, DEPT tool improves the sensitivity of the analysis due to the enhancement in the signal-to-noise ratio, which is important for this type of analysis contributing to the characterization of olive oils.

AB According to EU Regulations, all components of commercial compound feed need to be declared on the label. Effective protection against fraud requires severe controls based on accurate analytical methods to ascertain what is declared by the producers. The aim of this work was to develop an oligonucleotide microarray for the molecular recognition of multiple plant components in commercial feeds. We tested the potential of the highly polymorphic first intron sequences from members of the plant beta-tubulin gene family as a target for plant DNA identification. 23 oligonucleotide capture probes, targeting species-specific intron sequences, were assembled within a low density microarray for the identification of 10 plant species, selected from among those most commonly used in cattle feed formulation. The ability of the array to detect specific components in complex flour blends and in compound feed was evaluated. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; PESTICIDE-RESIDUES; WATER
AB The unreliability of traceability information on agricultural inputs has become one of the main factors hindering the development of traceability systems. At present, the major detection techniques of agricultural inputs were residue chemical detection at the postproduction stage. In this paper, a new detection method based on sensors and artificial intelligence algorithm was proposed in the detection of the commonly agricultural inputs in Agastache rugosa cultivation. An agricultural input monitoring platform including software system and hardware circuit was designed and built. A model called stacked sparse denoising autoencoder-hierarchical extreme learning machine-softmax (SSDA-HELM-SOFTMAX) was put forward to achieve accurate and real-time prediction of agricultural input varieties. The experiments showed that the combination of sensors and discriminant model could accurately classify different agricultural inputs. The accuracy of SSDA-HELM-SOFTMAX reached 97.08%, which was 4.08%, 1.78%, and 1.58% higher than a traditional BP neural network, DBN-SOFTMAX, and SAE-SOFTMAX models, respectively. Therefore, the method proposed in this paper was proved to be effective, accurate, and feasible and will provide a new online detection way of agricultural inputs.

AB The development and implementation of effective systems to identify vulnerabilities in food chains to chemical and microbiological contaminants must take account of consumer priorities and preferences. The present investigation attempted to understand consumer perceptions associated with chemical and microbiological contaminants in four specific food chains (drinking water, farmed salmon, chicken and milk powder). To this end, ten focus group discussions were held in five different countries (Poland, Ireland, the Netherlands, France and Brazil). Consumers expressed higher concerns about chemical, as compared with microbial, contaminants. Chemical contaminants were more strongly associated with the potential for severe consequences, long-term effects and lack of personal control. Traceability was considered by consumers as a useful tool that offers the potential to improve consumer confidence in food safety.

AB Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the most important cereal crops and is consumed as a staple food around the globe. Wheat authentication has become a crucial issue over the last decades. Recently, many techniques have been applied in wheat authentication including the authentication of wheat geographical origin, wheat variety, organic wheat, and wheat flour from other cereals. This paper collected related literature in the last ten years, and attempted to highlight the recent studies on the discrimination and authentication of wheat using different determination techniques and chemometric methods. The stable isotope analysis and elemental profile of wheat are promising tools to obtain information regarding the origin, and variety, and to differentiate organic from conventional farming of wheat. Image analysis, genetic parameters, and omics analysis can provide solutions for wheat variety, organic wheat, and wheat adulteration. Vibrational spectroscopy analyses, such as NIR, FTIR, and HIS, in combination with multivariate data analysis methods, such as PCA, LDA, and PLS-DA, show great potential in wheat authenticity and offer many advantages such as user-friendly, cost-effective, time-saving, and environment friendly. In conclusion, analytical techniques combining with appropriate multivariate analysis are very effective to discriminate geographical origin, cultivar classification, and adulterant detection of wheat.

DE olive oil; varietal origin; H-1 NMR; C-13 NMR DEPT 45
AB This work encompasses the use of 1D multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, namely, H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR DEPT 45, combined with a multivariate statistical analysis to characterize olive oils produced from nine different varieties: Galega Vulgar, Cobrancosa, Cordovil de Serpa, Blanqueta, Madural, Verdeal Alentejana, Arbequina, Picual and Carrasquenha. Thus, the suitability of an NMR-based spectroscopic tool to discriminate olive oils according to their varietal origin is addressed. The results obtained show that the model based on C-13 NMR DEPT 45 data has a stronger performance than the model based on H-1 NMR data, proving to be promising in the discrimination of the olive oils under study based on their varietal origin, being particularly relevant for olive oils of the Galega Vulgar variety.

DE traceability; visual identification; tracking; farm management
AB Two-plated self-piercing eartags were first developed in the 19th century, but information on their retention rates is scarce. A method is presented that facilitates estimation of eartag retention rate by using a random sample of cows that initially had 2 tags (1 on each ear) placed for identification and at least 1 of which survived. Striving to adopt the European Union standard for cattle ear tagging, the Israeli veterinary service conducted a field test to evaluate the performance of plastic eartags under the conditions of a typical Israeli dairy farm. The initial sample (n = 900 cows) was tagged on a single farm. Retention rates were estimated based on the ratio between the observed numbers of cows with 1 or 2 eartags in the surviving group (n = 97 cows). Based on this long-term (>3 yr) field test, the highest yearly retention of flag eartags (0.89 + 0.03) was lower than expected (0.98). Tag design and on-farm management were key factors affecting tag retention. A better design of the feedline yoke system in the feeding area, avoiding slits that can entangle the eartags, would help increase tag retention.

AB The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the use of alanine-EPR as a transfer standard dosimetry system for low energy X radiation, such as that in RS-2400, which operates in the range from 25 to 150 kV and 2 to 45 mA. Two types of alanine dosimeters were investigated. One is a commercial alanine pellets from Aerial-Centre de Ressources Technologiques, France and one was prepared in our laboratory (LMRI-DEN/UFPE). The EPR spectra of the irradiated dosimeters were recorded in the Nuclear Energy Department of UFPE, using a Bruker EMX10 EPR spectrometer operating in the X-band. The alanine-EPR dosimetry system was calibrated in the range of 20-220 Gy in this X-ray field, against an ionization chamber calibrated at the relevant X-ray energy with traceability to PTB. The results showed that both alanine dosimeters presented a linear dose response the same sensitivity, when the EPR signal was normalized to alanine mass. The total uncertainty in the measured dose was estimated to be about 3%. The results indicate that it is possible to use the alanine-EPR dosimetry system for validation of a low-energy X ray irradiator, such as RS-2400. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Functional agro biodiversity defines the exploitation of biodiversity to provide ecosystem services, support sustainable agricultural production and benefit the regional and global environment and the public at large (ELN-FAB, 2009; www.eln_fab.eu). Tracking of animal products back to the breed of origin based on their genetic make-up undoubtedly falls in this category. The aim of this paper was to identify and validate a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in goat coat colour genes, most of which have not been investigated before, to trace five goat populations of the Italian Alps and their product. Several regions of 28 genes influencing coat colour pathways were amplified in eight animals (two per breed). Sequence comparison revealed 48 SNPs and three INDEL (INsertion DELetion). No breed-specific alleles were detected; however, several SNPs showed an uneven frequency distribution between breeds. In BIO, the genotype frequency distribution of a non-synonymous SNP suggested a possible role of TYRP1 in brown eumelanic goat coat colour. A total of 29 independent SNPs in 20 genes were selected and used to allocate 159 minimally related goat samples using STRUCTURE 2.2 and GeneClass 2 software. STRUCTURE 2.2 assigns 99% of individuals to the correct breed considering the prior information on putative breed of origin for each sample and 81% using only the genotypic data. The three algorithms available in GeneClass 2 performed with nearly equal efficiency, with 86% and 87% correct allocations. All the methods yielded an average probability of assignment >0.92 and a specificity index >0.86. Despite their coat colour variability, individuals belonging to ORO were fully assigned, showing that, in the absence of a breed-specific allele tied to coat colour, the best assignment resulted for the most genetically distinct breed. The lowest rate of correct assignment was observed in Verzaschese (73%), not ascertained in the breed panel used in the SNP discovery phase.

AB Numerous influential animal breeds and plant varieties provide high-quality and nutritious foods for human. The popularity and high profit of premium foods usually accompany with adulterated products, which harmed rights of both consumers and law-abiding producers. So, it is necessary to build an effective breed identification system using genetic markers genotyped from meat products to safeguard public and increase confidence of consumers. To improve the accuracy of breed identification, six machine learning methods were evaluated using different number of breed tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and different size of training sets from 13 pig breeds. Herein, six machine learning methods were Na?ve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks and Decision Tree. Results showed that using breed tag SNPs increased identification accuracy compared with random SNPs. For SVM, accuracy of using 20 breed tag SNPs and 200 random SNPs were 99.30 (?0.14%) and 99.13 (?0.11%), respectively. Among the six methods, both RF and SVM methods were robust across all tested scenarios. Additionally, the accuracy of breed identification first increased with the size of training set and then remained stable in Test-in-training breeds test set. Overall, it can be deduced that breed tag SNPs, machine learning methods and training set size play important roles in ensuring the accuracy of breed identification.

To formulate the Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) Method, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were screened and a total of 104 SNP loci were fixed in the original Tokyo X strain of these, researchers selected 8 SNPs which are recognisable by restriction endonucleases and have high polymorphism within. other major commercial breeds and market pork. The combined exclusion probability of general commercial pork and Berkshire pork from Tokyo X was 98.1 and 97.4%, respectively. The SNP marker set developed in this study will be useful in preventing fake Tokyo X brand pork from appearing on the market.

AB Medicinal plants such as Cassia, Senna, and Chamaecrista (belonging to the family Fabaceae) are well known for their laxative properties. They are extensively used within indigenous health care systems in India and several other countries. India exports over 5000 metric tonnes per year of these specific herbal products, and the demand for natural health product market is growing at approximately 10-15 % annually. The raw plant material used as active ingredients is almost exclusively sourced from wild populations. Consequently, it is widely suspected that the commercial herbal products claiming to contain these species may be adulterated or contaminated. In this study, we have attempted to assess product authentication and the extent of adulteration in the herbal trade of these species using DNA barcoding. Our method includes four common DNA barcode regions: ITS, matK, rbcL, and psbA-trnH. Analysis of market samples revealed considerable adulteration of herbal products: 50 % in the case of Senna auriculata, 37 % in Senna tora, and 8 % in Senna alexandrina. All herbal products containing Cassia fistula were authentic, while the species under the genus Chamaecrista were not in trade. Our results confirm the suspicion that there is rampant herbal product adulteration in Indian markets. DNA barcodes such as that demonstrated in this study could be effectively used as a regulatory tool to control the adulteration of herbal products and contribute to restoring quality assurance and consumer confidence in natural health products.

AB Accurate time-series crop leaf area index (LAI) monitoring can provide data support for field management and early yield estimation. The Sentinel-2 satellite has a high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution, and its unique three red-edge bands provide an ideal data source for LAI estimation. However, the inconsistent spatial resolution of different bands hinders the application potential of Sentinel-2 images. In view of this problem, we focused on mining more infor-mation provided by the high spatial resolution bands of Sentinel-2 images using the Super-Resolution for Multispectral Multiresolution Estimation (SupReME) algorithm. Furthermore, The SNAP (Sentinel Application Platform) biophysical processor and the PROSAIL radiation transfer model coupled with Random Forest (RF) model were applied to estimate time-series LAI of maize canopy at 10 m spatial resolution, and the Leaf Area Index Wireless Sensor Network (LAINet) measurements were used for accuracy verification. Finally, the effectiveness of images reconstructed by SupReME and the two inversion methods for time-series LAI estimation were evaluated. The results showed that: (1) the Sentinel-2 images reconstructed by SupReME can improve spatial characteristics while maintaining spectral invariance, and they were more advantageous for LAI estimation than the original images; (2) The SNAP biophysical processor suits a quick large-scale estimation with robustness, while the PROSAIL coupled RF model achieved a higher coefficient of determination (R2) and a lower root mean square error (RMSE) (R2 increased by more than 0.1, RMSE decreased by more than 0.33) for time -series LAI estimation in this specific study area; (3) both inversion methods showed apparent underestimation at the late growth stage. This study verifies the feasibility of obtaining high spatial resolution images using a super-resolution algo-rithm for LAI inversion and provides the effect of two commonly used inversion methods for time-series LAI estimation at 10 m resolution.

AB Cassiae Semen (Sicklepod seeds), a popular Chinese traditional medicinal tea that is roasted, crushed, and infused in boiled water to make a commonly used traditional tea drink. The quality and efficacity of Cassiae Semen are closely related to its geographical origin. Therefore, stable isotope (delta C-13, delta N-15, delta H-2, and delta O-18) and multi-element (32 elements) chemometrics were used to develop a geographical discrimination method for Cassiae Semen. In this study, significant isotopic and elemental differences (p < 0.05) were found for Cassiae Semen teas from different growing regions in China and Vietnam. Regional samples were separated using unsupervised PCA, and OPLS-DA identified specific elemental and isotopic variables (K, Ca, Mg, Al, Fe, Ba, and delta H-2) as key origin discrimination markers. OPLS-DA had a high discrimination accuracy rate (100 % and 99.6 %) for high-quality Cassiae Semen tea cultivated in Xinchang County, Zhejiang Province (ZJXC), China, and Hanoi Province, Vietnam (VIEHN), respectively. Multi-element and stable isotope analyses combined with chemometrics provide a promising method to confirm the geographical origin of Cassiae Semen.

AB The conservation of landraces in Europe is challenging because very often they have already disappeared or cannot be properly identified, which in turn prevents any possibility for their utilization. This work deals with the collection of molecular and historical data to identify and study the original landraces of common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench), locally cultivated in Northern Italy (Valtellina) and to date surviving among other commercial varieties, recently introduced in the same areas of the Alps. As plant materials of F. esculentum, we analyzed a number of Italian accessions along with two foreign accessions from Poland and Nepal, for a total of 174 individuals. Molecular investigations were based on a set of eight nuclear SSR marker loci. The mean observed heterozygosity over all accessions was equal to H-o = 0.466, being significantly lower than the expected heterozygosity (H-e = 0.764). A major finding was the recognition of a marked inbreeding rate (F-it = 0.387) and a reduced fixation index (F-st = 0.061), indicating that most genetic variation is found within populations. A significant overall gene flow among accessions was found (N-m = 3.846). Results indicated that only two of the examined accessions, the so-called "Nustran" and "Curunin", could be considered, authentic Valtellina landraces. On the basis of results, we successfully developed a multi-locus marker system and identified a number of co-dominant marker alleles suitable for genetic traceability and authenticity certification of a "Nustran" and a "Curunin" autochthonous landraces of Valtellina and its food derivatives (i.e., Pizzoccheri, Polenta taragna).

AB Freshwater bodies are key in supporting aquatic and terrestrial life. Ecological balance of freshwater habitats is very vulnerable, hence, often significantly disrupted by climatic changes and anthropogenic acts. In Israel, due to its relatively arid climate, many freshwater resources have been disrupted and still are under great pressure. The Sea of Galilee is the largest surface freshwater body in the Middle East and a habitat to unique populations of several fishes, including six cichlid species. Studies on the ecology of these fish and their conservation require effective monitoring tools. In this study, a simple and efficient molecular method was developed to identify the species of these lake cichlids using high resolution melting analysis of mini DNA barcodes. The species of an individual sample can be identified by a single tube PCR reaction. This assay successfully identified sequence differences both among and within species. Here, this method identified the species for 279 small cichlid fry that could not be morphologically identified, allowing to estimate relative species abundance and map their distribution in time and location. The results are key to understand not only the ecology of young stages but also their recruitment potential to adult fish populations and their sustainability. This method can be readily implemented in further ecological studies and surveys related to these species, in the lake and its surroundings, as a tool to enhance understanding and protection of these species.

AB It is common sense in the food industry to guarantee the food safety by establishing the traceability mechanism which can make all aspects more transparent from farm to fork. This paper views the RFID technology as an operation strategy to ensure food safety, and proposes three pricing decision models according to different operation strategies and market situations. It is shown that two factors, the production substitutability and the basic market share, influence the retailers' operation strategies. No matter how two factors change, the dual-channel system is always the best choice for the retailers. By investigating consumers' behaviors and preferences, we find that most consumers in Zhengzhou city prefer to buy food from the low-end market, and the retailers, however, prefers to sale via the dual-channel system, which is in accordance with the result of models.

AB Background: White ginseng (Panax ginseng Meyer) is commonly distributed as a health food in food markets. However, there is no practical method for distinguishing Korean white ginseng (KWG) from Chinese white ginseng (CWG), except for relying on the traceability system in the market.
   Methods: Ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry combined with orthogonal partial least squares discrimination analysis (OPLS-DA) was employed to discriminate between KWG and CWG.
   Results: The origins of white ginsengs in two test sets (1.0 mu L and 0.2 mu L injections) could be successfully discriminated by the OPLS-DA analysis. From OPLS-DA S-plots, KWG exhibited tentative markers derived from ginsenoside Rf and notoginsenoside R3 isomer, whereas CWG exhibited tentative markers derived from ginsenoside Ro and chikusetsusaponin Iva.
   Conclusion: Results suggest that ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry coupled with OPLS-DA is an efficient tool for identifying the difference between the geographical origins of white ginsengs.

AB Italian almond germplasm is characterized by a wide diversity in several growing areas among which Sicily is one of the most important. Analysis with consensus and specific primers and DNA sequencing was performed to investigate S-RNase genetic diversity and to elucidate the homology rate within a genetic pool of 27 Italian accessions. Interestingly, some of the self-compatible cultivars did not show the presence of S-f allele. Amplicons from consensus and allele-specific PCR primers revealed a high level of variability. Sequencing of all the S-RNase amplicons derived from consensus primers allowed the identification of two new S-RNase alleles (S-51 and S-52). Surprisingly, despite the AA replacement mutation, S51 did not exhibit any change of its S-RNase function. Additionally, several mutations, with no effect on amino acid composition, were detected in the intron and/or in the ORF of four known alleles (S-g, S-10, S-31 and S-35). Genetic variation, regarding point mutations and only detected by sequencing, was revealed among 11 of 27 tested cultivars. The new sources of variability might have an interest for product traceability.

AB The European and national laws concerning the identification and registration of livestock are meant to make possible their traceability and facilitate food safety and animal health, especially in case of a disease outbreak; such rules have also become prerequisites that farmers must meet to obtain single farm payments under the common agricultural policy. Failure to comply with these obligations entails the reduction or exclusion from direct payments.
   Act A7, reports the obligations imposed by the EC Regulation 1760/2000 establishing a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and regarding the labelling of beef and beef products;
   Act A8, report the obligations established by the EC Reg. 21/2004 establishing a system for the identification and registration of sheep and goats.
   The project MO.NA.CO. monitored the application of rules for identification and registration of cattle, sheep and goats and their costs. The system of identification and registration of dairy cows resulted well organized with a good level of coordination between the involved actors in both farms. The activities necessary for compliance with rules of identification and registration of cattle are distributed throughout the year, but vary from day to day. The average total cost for annual obligations amounted to (sic) 533.34 year(--1) while the average cost for individual fulfilment in the monitoring period amounted to (sic) 4.10. Even in the case of sheep and goats, the monitoring showed a good cooperation between farms and technicians. However, some difficulties were detected, mainly due to the size of the rumen boluses and the limited effectiveness of the ear tags. The operators suggested using smaller rumen boluses and tattoo instead of ear tags; they also suggest to extend the period within which the animals have to be labelled from the current 6 months to 9 months. The cost of compliance amounted to (sic) 5.27 head(-1) for sheep and (sic) 4.90 head(-1) for goats.

AB The effect of different diets on the content of carotenoids, fat-soluble vitamins (retinal and tocopherol) and color measurements in sheep tissues was assessed, to study the possible links with the livestock production system for both nutrition and traceability. Three groups of animals were considered: 15 lambs fed on pasture (G1), 15 lambs fed on concentrate (G2) and 15 suckling lambs (G3) whose mothers were grass-fed. Lutein and p-carotene appeared only in plasma from grazing lambs, so they appear useful to differentiate lambs fed on pasture. Furthermore, retinal and a-tocopherol content in fat were significantly higher (p < 0.01) in the animals fed on an extensive system (1.48 +/- 0.08 and 42.4 +/- 1.76 mu g/g fat, respectively) than those fed on an intensive one (1.03 +/- 0.08 and 34.8 +/- 0.23 mu g/g fat, respectively). When fat-soluble vitamin (retinal and tocopherol) levels and the absolute value of the integral from the reflectance spectrum, between 450 and 510 nm, from fat samples were used in a discriminant model, 100% of the lambs were correctly classified according to their feeding system (pasture vs. concentrate).

AB The efficacy of isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) in tracing lamb production systems was investigated for four farming systems in the Tunisian North-West: Ain Draham and Fernana, characterised by woody pasture, and Amdoun and Joumine, characterised by herbaceous pasture. Mixed breed lambs aged 3.5-5 months were reared under semi-extensive and extensive systems. Samples of Longissimus dorsi muscle were taken from eight lambs for each farming system for stable IR assessment of the five main bio-elements in the protein and fat fractions of lamb and for fatty acid (FA) determination. Using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) the IR profiles of Tunisian lamb types allowed correct assignment of the training meat samples to the area of origin. Inclusion of the FA profile in the classification model slightly improved its evaluation performance for the individual farming systems; the average accuracy increased by 2%-94%. However, the differences between samples were not sufficiently wide to be validated by an external set of samples including 10 Italian lamb types. A broader scale geographical signature discriminating lambs from the Amdoun area, the rest of north-west Tunisia and Italy appeared to be workable, although some foreign lamb types from neighbouring Mediterranean regions such as Sicily were misclassified as Tunisian.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of diet (grazing vs. pasture silage with concentrate) and changes in diet on n-alkane concentrations in cattle feces. The experiment lasted 35 d (15 d of adaptation and 20 d of sampling). Thirty Holstein-Friesian steers were divided into three groups of ten, and each group was randomly allocated to one of the following three treatments: GZ, diet consisting of 100% pasture; SC, diet consisting of pasture silage: concentrate in a 60: 40 ratio; and MX, diet consisting of a gradual decrease in pasture and a gradual increase in SC. Fecal samples were taken daily from every animal, and their n-alkane content was analyzed using gas chromatography. The data obtained in this study showed detectable changes in n-alkane concentrations in steer feces. The changes were noticeable within two to three d after a change in diet, whereas concentrations of n-alkanes remained stable in the feces of animals that did not experience any change in diet. These results can be used as the basis for developing a tool that can determine the type of feed bovines received prior to slaughter.

AB The demand for beef resources in Indonesia is always increasing every year. However, Indonesia's national beef supply cannot meet those needs. The import of beef in large numbers likely to remain performed. The government has made various efforts to reduce imports and achieve self-sufficiency in beef. However, the government does not yet have a good identification, registration, documentation, and traceability system, so there is no truly valid data regarding the actual stock condition. Inaccuracy of data can lead to inappropriate policymaking in the livestock sector. Therefore, an e-Government initiative in the form of e-Livestock has been proposed. The definitions and success factors regarding e-Livestock have been revealed in our previous researches. Based on those researches, by using soft system methodology, hermeneutics, focus group discussion, and success factors, the business process models for e-Livestock in Indonesia will be created in this research. Apart from that, various kinds of recommendations for action to solve the problem will also be generated from this research. Those recommendations are about the functional requirement, the identification tool, the location numbering rule, the ownership documentation, the socialization of the e-Livestock, the institutional aspect of e-Livestock, the regulations underlie eLivestock and the conceptual infrastructure diagram of e-Livestock. All of the business process models produced have been validated and their complexities are also calculated. Most of the business process model is very easy to understand. All the business process models and recommendations generated from this research can be a guide for the government when implementing e-Livestock.

AB Animal species identification has received growing attention, regarding genetic diversity and food traceability. The objective of this study is to apply a universal primer of part of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene analysis using the PCR-RFLP and HRM methods for identification of species origin in cattle, chicken, horse, sheep, pig, buffalo, and goat. PCR product size was 512 bp. The PCR product of 16S rRNA was digested with two restriction enzymes (BclI and MseI); sufficient to easily generate analyzable species-specific restriction profiles that could distinguish the unambiguity of all targeted species. The HRM method successfully identified all species by shape of melting temperature, and proved to be of higher resolution, and a more cost effective, alternative method compared with other identification techniques.

AB Cloud computing offers on-demand availability of computing resources over the Internet. To attract users, cloud providers offer their resources as services at reasonable prices and provide various price models to reflect higher level of quality of service (QoS), which are referred as pricing schemes. k-times anonymous authentication (k-TAA) is an attractive approach to construct pricing schemes, providing access controllability, user anonymity and public traceability. In k-TAA schemes, authenticated users are permitted to anonymously access services from a provider at most k times, while the ones whose the number of access times exceeds k can be publicly traced. That is, k-TM schemes offer a prepaid plan that charges users based on the amount of access times. Alternatively, pay-as-you-go (PAYG) is a pricing strategy that allows users to be charged based on the amount of usage, reducing the costs on unnecessary resources. Adopting k-TM schemes to PAYG model, the access bound k is decided by the prepayment amount and the service usage is tracked by the number of access times. However, this approach is impractical, since existing k-TAA schemes only allow an one-time access in an authentication. This article aims to bridge this gap in the literature by designing an efficient and secure authentication system for PAYG cloud computing, supporting flexible access controllability, user anonymity and public traceability. To achieve this, we propose a new k-TM primitive, called k-times anonymous pay-as-you-go authentication (k-TM-PAYG), that allows users to access services for multiple times in an authentication as long as the number of their access times does not exceed k. We first formalize the definition and security model for k-TAA-PAYG scheme. Subsequently, we present a concrete construction of k-TAA-PAYG scheme, with the computational complexity as O(1) and the constant communicational cost. Finally, comparing with the most efficient k-TAA scheme proposed by Emura et al., the experimental results show that our k-TM-PAYG scheme is 2.5 to 3 times faster and saves up to 66 percent storage in grant processes. The time cost of an authentication of our k-TAA-PAYG scheme is constant (1.4-2.4 ms), while Emura et al.'s scheme needs more than one second when the number of access time is greater than 1, 000.

AB A novel home-made H2SO4-Nafion (HN) tube sampling system coupled to a line ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ-MS) with a versatile ambient ionization source, hectowatt microwave plasma torch (HMPT), has manifested unique advantages for picking directly metal elements in aqueous samples and acquiring the fully characteristic MPT mass spectra of copper and zinc composite ions. Here, we report the development of a novel HN-HMPT-LTQ-MS for metal elements assay based on environmental water to analyze samples of Poyang Lake, China. Detailed multi-stage tandem mass spectra show that the general structural form of target ions is [M(NO3)(x)(H2O)(y)(OH)(z)](+) for the positive ion mode. Under the optimized conditions, the proposed method provided low limits of detection (LODs) of 0.23 mu g.L-1 for Cu-63(+) and 1.1 mu g.L-1 for Zn-66(+), with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of less than 12.7% by MPT-LTQ-MS. This new result has met the requirements of national standards (GB 5750.6-2006) and is only about one magnitude order larger than the LOD of ICP-MS method. A wide linear response range of about 4 orders of magnitude for the method with linear coefficients (R-2) of 0.99709 - 0.99962 for copper and zinc tested was in accordance with that of ICP-MS. Except for the recovery of 79% for the third sample and 123.8% for the seventh sample, the present method also provided good recoveries (84 - 119.3%) in spiked 10 batches of drinking water samples. Furthermore, it is envisioned that the developed approach might build a powerful hectowatt-MPT-MS platform for food security detection, drug analysis, and origin traceability.

AB Authentication of a food product is the procedure by which it is verified that the product matches the statements on the label, and that it conforms to what is established by regulations. This testing process includes analysis of the ingredients, determination of the geographical origin, and examination of the production methods. In particular, the use of rapid, effective and reliable analytical methods, when correctly applied to verify the authenticity and the traceability of the product, represents a valuable and irreplaceable tool for the authorities to carry out control functions. Tools and methodologies from scientific innovation and technological evolution can help to quickly locate particularly sophisticated frauds and adulterations. The feeding regime of livestock is a fundamental issue for the properties and safety of animal origin food, but this regime is often hidden from the consumer, making the zootechnical sector more prone to fraudulent practices. This review reports the results recently obtained in authentication of animal origin food by the application of stable-isotope ratio analysis, the most promising analytical technique in this field.

AB Multivariate stable isotope analysis combined with chemometrics was used to investigate and discriminate rice samples from six rice producing provinces in China (Heilongjiang, Jilin, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan and Guizhou) and four other Asian rice producing countries (Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, and Pakistan). The stable isotope characteristics were analyzed for rice of different species cultivated with varied farming methods at different altitudes and latitudes/longitudes. The index groups of delta C-13, delta N-15, delta O-18, Pb-207/206 and Pb-208/207 were screened and established for the selected samples with different geographical features by means of principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant analysis (DA), which would provide a sound technical solution for rice traceability and serve as a template for further research on the traceability of other agricultural products, especially plant-derived products.

AB Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) comprise a class of organic compounds of petrogenic origins or generated from the incomplete combustion of organic matter. Their presence in the environment can be a source of food contamination, which implies a potential risk to human health according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Additionally, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO/WHO) and the Scientific Committee on Food consider PAHs to be genotoxic and carcinogenic. The greatest concern has been raised regarding the possibility of cancer induction in humans exposed to PAHs from contaminated food. Therefore, many regulations and reports regarding strategies for and results of food monitoring have been published, including performance criteria for the sampling, chemical analysis and maximum permitted levels of these contaminants in food. A variety of techniques have been reported for the extraction, clean-up and determination steps of the analytical process. The details and advantages of each technique are discussed in this chapter. Additionally, because method validation is one measure that laboratories must implement to guarantee the reliability, traceability and comparability of their results, a review and critical analysis of the current practices in this area are also presented.

AB Geographical traceability of marine bivalves was crucial to avoid food fraud, to guarantee food quality and to protect the interests of both consumers and importers. In order to evaluate the availability of using stable isotope ratio and content of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), and hydrogen (H) combined with multivariate analysis for the origin traceability of mussels, 120 samples collected from four major production provinces in China were analyzed. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used for data exploratory analysis, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to evaluate their performance in terms of classification or predictive ability. Results showed that there was a significant difference (p < 0.05) in the eight variables in mussels from different origins, which proved that these signals were useful for identifying the origins of mussels. Based on the PCA, there was no clear distinction among the mussels from different regions. The LDA gave an overall accuracy rate of 92.8%, cross-validated accuracy rate of 86.7% and predictive accuracy rate of 92.3%. Present findings suggested that the stable isotope ratio and compositions analysis of C, N, O, and H could be potentially applied to the geographical origin traceability of China mussels assisted by multivariate data analysis.

AB The Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF), where competent authorities in each Member State (MS) submit notifications on the withdrawal of unsafe or illegal products from the market, makes a significant contribution to food safety control in the European Union. The aim of this paper is to frame the potential challenges of interpreting and then acting upon the dataset contained within the RASFF system. As it is largest cause of RASFF notifications, the lens of enquiry used is mycotoxin contamination. The methodological approach is to firstly iteratively review existing literature to frame the problem, and then to interrogate the RASFF system and analyze the data available. Findings are that caution should be exercised in using the RASFF database both as a predictive tool and for trend analysis, because iterative changes in food law impact on the frequency of regulatory sampling associated with border and inland regulatory checks. The study highlights the variability of engagement by MSs with the RASFF database, influencing generalisability of the trends noted. As importing countries raise market standards, there are wider food safety implications for the exporting countries themselves. As this is one of the first studies articulating the complexities and opportunities of using the RASFF database, this research makes a strong contribution to literature.

AB BACKGROUND Confirmation of food labeling that claims production in a small geographic region is critical to traceability, quality control and brand protection. In the current study, isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) was used to generate profiles of delta C-13 and delta N-15 to determine if the stable isotope signatures of Keemun black tea differ within the three counties that claim production. Other factors (cultivar type, leaf maturity and manufacturing process) were considered for their potential effects. RESULTS Both cultivar type and leaf maturity have remarkable impact on the delta N-15 values of tea leaves, and that the cultivar influenced the delta C-13 values. Keemun black tea from Qimen county could be easily discriminated from samples from Dongzhi and Guichi counties based on delta N-15 signatures. The k-NN model was cross-validated with an accuracy of 91.6%. Environmental factors and/or genotype seem to be the major reasons for delta N-15 differences in Keemun black tea from the selected regions. CONCLUSION This article provides a potential effective method to delineate the geographic point-of-origin of Keemun black tea based on delta N-15 signatures. (c) 2018 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Recent trade agreements will expand Canada's market access commitments for dairy products. We explore whether Canadian consumers will respond to the increased presence of imported dairy products using a discrete choice experiment that accounts for price, country-of-origin (COO), production method, brand, and traceability. We use four processed dairy products to illustrate potential trade-offs: Gouda and cheddar cheese, ice cream, and yogurt. There are statistically significant discounts associated with COO effects. These discounts vary with the dairy product and are large compared to consumer valuation of other included attributes. We find large premiums for traceability programs, suggesting that the absence of assurances related to traceability may mute actual market penetration arising from increased access to the Canadian dairy market.

AB The potential of DNA barcoding was tested as a system for studying genetic diversity and genetic traceability in bean germplasm. This technique was applied to several pure lines of Phaseolus vulgaris L. belonging to wild, domesticated, and cultivated common beans, along with some accessions of Phaseolus coccineus L., Phaseolus lunatus L., and Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp. A multilocus approach was exploited using three chloroplast genic regions (rbcL, trnL, and matK), four intergenic spacers (rpoB-trnC, atpBrbcL, trnT-trnL, and psbA-trnH), and nuclear ITS1 and ITS2 rDNA sequences. Our main goals were to identify the markers and SNPs that show the best discriminant power at the variety level in common bean germplasm, to examine two methods (tree based versus character based) for biodiversity analysis and traceability assays, and to evaluate the overall utility of chloroplast DNA barcodes for reconstructing the origins of modern Italian varieties. Our results indicate that the neighbor-joining method is a powerful approach for comparing genetic diversity within plant species, but it is relatively uninformative for the genetic traceability of plant varieties. In contrast, the character-based method was able to identify several distinct haplotypes over all target regions corresponding to Mesoamerican or Andean accessions; Italian accessions originated from both gene pools. On the whole, our findings raise some concerns about the use of DNA barcoding for intraspecific genetic diversity studies in common beans and highlights its limitations for resolving genetic relationships between landraces and varieties.

AB In this paper, five C and N metabolites and eighteen mineral elements were used to identify the cigar's geographical origin on a country scale (Dominica, Indonesia, and China) and on a prefecture scale (Yuxi, Puer, and Lincang in China). The results show that the best origin traceability method is the combination of C and N metabolites and mineral elements method. Its. Its accuracy of cross-validation can achieve 95% on a country scale and 94% on a prefecture scale. Determination accuracy is ranked as identification by combination > mineral elements> C and N metabolites. For geo-origin determination of cigars, mineral element identification is better than that metabolite identification. The algorithm and factors for origin determination are selected. The results can be used to guide cigar agricultural practices and monitor and regulate the cigar in production and circulation.

AB Jujube is widely grown in Xinjiang province, China, including two high-value PGI products, Charkhlik Hui jujube and Khotan Jun jujube. Origin mislabeling and substitution of PGI jujube by inferior products seriously harms their reputation and has potential food safety risks. In this study, stable isotope (delta C-13, delta N-15, delta H-2, delta O-18) and elemental (Na, Mg, Al, P, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Sr, Mo, Cd, Sb, Ba, Pb) compositions of jujube from five different regions across Xinjiang province were analyzed by orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) to verify the geographical origin of jujube and authenticate PGI products. A total of 167 Hui jujube and 156 Jun jujube samples, together with their associated soils were collected annually from 2013 to 2018. The regional, varietal and inter-annual differences of stable isotope and elemental compositions of jujube and their correlation with soil values were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and multivariate statistics. The discriminant accuracies of OPLS-DA modeling for both Hui and Jun jujube samples collected in 2016 were higher than 90 %. Over a longer five-year (from 2013 to 2018), the discriminant accuracies decreased slightly, but were still acceptable at 85 % and 75 % for the two varieties. The most important variables for discrimination models were Na, Al, Ba, and delta C-13 for Hui jujube, delta O-18 and delta N-15 for Jun jujube, respectively. The study show that this strategy holds good promise as a tool to combat mislabeling and fraudulent conduct and has the ability to protect PGI jujube produced in Xinjiang province.

AB Only some animal species could be transformed into halal salami and the raw meat must be obtained from ritually slaughtered animals. Several scientific studies have been conducted on ritual slaughtering practices and manufacturing of meat products for Jewish and Muslim religious communities; furthermore, many projects have been funded by the European Community on this topic. The authenticity and traceability of meat is one of the priorities of halal food certification systems. The pig matrix (meat and/or lard) may be fraudulently present in halal processed meat, as well as salami, for both economic and technological purposes; in fact, the use of these raw materials reflects the easier availability and their lower cost; furthermore, it allows manufacturers to obtain final products with better quality (sensory properties) and stability (especially with respect to oxidative reactions). The aim of this review is to discuss the qualitative and technological aspects of halal raw meat for dry fermented sausages (salami); moreover, this study focuses on the most recent studies carried out on the certification system and on the analytical methods performed in order to solve problems such as fraud and adulteration of halal salami and other halal meat foods.

AB The consequent and accurate monitoring of the seasonal dynamics of crop leaf area index (LAI) is critical to yield estimation and agriculture policy development. It is difficult for a single sensor to balance spatial and temporal resolution. Spatiotemporal fusion is an effective way to meet the need for high spatial and temporal applications. Among the fusion methods, regression model Fitting, spatial Filtering and residual Compensation (Fit-FC) may be recommended for vegetation dynamic monitoring because of its outperformance for the cases with considerable phenological changes. However, it is not good at capturing image structure and textures. To overcome the limitations, an enhanced version of Fit-FC, referred as Enhanced-Fit-FC (EFF), was developed. The EFF method can be applied with one (unidirectional prediction, Uni-EFF) or two (bidirectional prediction, Bi-EFF) coarse-fine image pairs as input for near real-time or post-growth applications. The visual and quantitative assessments indicated that EFF mitigated the blurring effect of Fit-FC and generated accurate reflectance, especially Bi-EFF contributed to capturing land cover changes. Compared with Fit-FC, the correlation coefficient (CC) and quality index (QI) of EFF increased by more than 0.12, and the root mean square error (RMSE) decreased by 0.16 at the maximum. Further, we identified the robustness and adaptability of deep neural network (DNN) model for time-series LAI estimation. The results substantiated the effectiveness of DNN in dealing with nonlinear problems and alleviating spectral saturation with higher CC and lower RMSE and relative RMSE (rRMSE) at whole growth-stages (CC=0.91, RMSE=0.28, and rRMSE=7.18%) and vegetative stage (CC=0.94, RMSE=0.24, and rRMSE=5.81%). In conclusion, the EFF method proposed in this study is competent in constructing time-series synthetic images for near real-time or post-growth applications. Moreover, the DNN model shows the potential for LAI estimation at whole growth-stages. This research not only contributes to dense time-series remote sensing-based applications (e.g., land cover change monitoring, yield forecast), but also is valuable for high-spatial-precision farmland management.

AB Public (dis)trust of conventionally produced food is now a pivotal issue for the Canadian food supply chain as consumers are increasingly demanding traceability, transparency and sustainability of the agri-food system. To ensure that Canadians understand what farmers do, how they do it, and why-there has been significant human and financial investment by both the agri-food industry and government over the last decade. Farmers, civil servants, and non-farming agricultural professionals alike are being encouraged to join the national conversation promoting the legitimacy of conventional agriculture. As part of this large-scale effort, women in agriculture (both on and off farm) are advocating, in gendered ways, for the safety and legitimacy of the agri-food system and its conventional farming practices. This is being done by utilizing their motherhood capital. This motherhood capital legitimizes the authority granted to mothers as expert decisionmakers regarding their children's food consumption. Through the usage of their motherhood capital, women are being positioned-and are positioning themselves-as an important voice in re-narrating the story of conventional agriculture through the circulation of their maternal foodwork experiences. Using their authority as mothers (and feeders or caretakers of families) they are advocating for the safety, necessity, and trustworthiness of conventional agriculture to counter narratives of mistrust and risk.

AB Featured Application Meat and meat products from autochthonous pig breeds enjoy a worldwide prestige because of their organoleptic, health, and sensory features. Nevertheless, these autochthonous breeds are characterized by a local production mainly derived from small populations, which make the assurance of traceability and quality control technically and/or economically feasible. Thus, a collective management would make possible the development of robust near-infrared calibration models, supporting the application of this technology to the traceability and quality control of meat derived from these native breeds in an efficient, practical, and affordable way Autochthonous pig breeds provide products of differentiated quality, among which quality control is difficult to perform and insufficient for current market requirements. The present research evaluates the predictive ability of near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, combined with chemometric methods as a rapid and affordable tool to assure traceability and quality control. Thus, NIR technology was assessed for intact and minced muscleLongissimus thoracis et lumborumsamples collected from 12 European autochthonous pig breeds for the quantification of lipid content and fatty acid composition. Different tests were performed using different numbers of samples for calibration and validation. The best predictive ability was found using minced presentation and set with 80% of the samples for the calibration and the remaining 20% for the external validation test for the following traits: lipid content and saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, which attained both the highest determination coefficients (0.89, 0.61, and 0.65, respectively) and the lowest root mean square errors in external validation (0.62, 1.82, and 1.36, respectively). Lower predictive ability was observed for intact muscles. These results could contribute to improve the management of autochthonous breeds and to ensure quality of their products by traditional meat industry chains.

AB Beer quality is a difficult concept to describe and assess by physicochemical and sensory analysis due to the complexity of beer appreciation and acceptability by consumers, which can be dynamic and related to changes in climate affecting raw materials, consumer preference, and rising quality requirements. Artificial intelligence (AI) may offer unique capabilities based on the integration of sensor technology, robotics, and data analysis using machine learning (ML) to identify specific quality traits and process modifications to produce quality beers. This research presented the integration and implementation of AI technology based on low-cost sensor networks in the form of an electronic nose (e-nose), robotics, and ML. Results of ML showed high accuracy (97%) in the identification of fermentation type (Model 1) based on e-nose data; prediction of consumer acceptability from near-infrared (Model 2; R = 0.90) and e-nose data (Model 3; R = 0.95), and physicochemical and colorimetry of beers from e-nose data. The use of the RoboBEER coupled with the e-nose and AI could be used by brewers to assess the fermentation process, quality of beers, detection of faults, traceability, and authentication purposes in an affordable, user-friendly, and accurate manner.

AB Increasing consumer awareness of the authenticity of products has led to a demand for rapid measurement methods to support the traceability of high-value commodities. In this research, a front-face method was used to obtain fluorescence excitation-emission matrix fingerprints of patchouli oil samples from different geographical origins in Indonesia. Principal component analysis (PCA) was then used to explore the excitation-emission matrix (EEM) data structure of the samples, and 3D eigenvector value thresholding was used to discriminate important variables. It was found that there were five important EEM regions representing the sample variation. A decision-tree model with a subset of two important regions, i.e. regions 1 and 3, was then developed for the classification of patchouli oils from different Indonesian islands. These results show that front-face fluorescence spectroscopy has the potential to be used as a supporting tool for the discrimination of the geographical origin of patchouli oils.

AB Wine authenticity methods are in increasing demand mainly in Denomination of Origin designations. The DNA-based methodologies are a reliable means of tracking food/wine varietal composition. The main aim of this work was the study of High Resolution Melting (HRM) application as a screening method for must and wine authenticity. Three sample types (leaf, must and wine) were used to validate the three developed HRM assays (Vv1-705 bp; Vv2-375 bp; and. Vv3-119 bp). The Vv1 HRM assay was only successful when applied to leaf and must samples. The Vv2 HRM assay successfully amplified all sample types, allowing genotype discrimination based on melting temperature values. The smallest amplicon, Vv3, produced a coincident melting curve shape in all sample types (leaf and wine) with corresponding genotypes. This study presents sensitive, rapid and efficient HRM assays applied for the first time to wine samples suitable for wine authenticity purposes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Food safety has attracted considerable public concern and press attention in recent years. Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCPs) is a systematic approach to food product safety as a means of prevention rather than finished product inspection. It has been internationally recognized and accepted as the system for effective food safety management. In this study, a system called Supply-chain Pedigree Interactive Dynamic Explore (SPIDER) is proposed as a platform for the public and governments to explore the information in each part of the food chain and provide easy implementation of HACCP into the food industry. SPIDER is a secure and global platform to verify, inspect and investigate food effectively and efficiently. In this system, some artificial intelligent techniques, Case-based Reasoning, Rule-based Reasoning, Fuzzy logical and Neural Network are used for automatic updating, to analyze data and to manage data. Finally, a simulated case is also studied to show the operation and the results of the system. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A survey was conducted among 1489 consumers in seven pilot cities designated by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce for constructing a meat circulation traceability system.This study set four attributes for pork: traceability information, quality certification, appearance, and price. The preferences and willingness to pay (WTP) of consumers for traceability information, quality certification, appearance attributes, and influencing factors were investigated using choice experiments. According to results from both mixed logit and latent class models, quality certification was the most important characteristic, followed by appearance, and traceability information. "Government certification," "very fresh-looking," and "traceability information covering farming, slaughter and processing, circulation and marketing" were the most preferred levels of quality certification, appearance, and traceability information, respectively. Significant heterogeneity was observed in the consumer preferences for these attributes. The preferences and WTP of consumers for traceability information and quality certification were significantly influenced by age, monthly family income, and education level. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB Traceability system has received wide attention in solving food safety issues, via which food information could be tracked back to producer/farmers. Consumers need to obtain this information from producers or social networks, trust in the information, and consequently assess perceived risks, especially when food scandals are exposed to the media. In this study, we introduce the social embeddedness theory to understand how consumers' social activities affect their risk perceptions on traceable food. Specifically, we investigate how risk perceptions are predicted by the interpersonal relationships, organizational level and social-level relationships. Results show that the interpersonal relationships were associated with lower levels of risk perceptions, while organizational and social relationships impacted consumer's risk perceptions at middle and higher levels, respectively. Results also show that the "ripple effect" extended to effect of risk events with negative information, however, did not exist for the group exposed to positive information. Potential food safety implications have been proposed to identify for effective risk mitigation under media coverages.

AB The effects of varieties, producing areas, ears, and ear positions of maize on near-infrared (NIR) spectra were investigated to determine the factors causing the differences in NIR fingerprints of maize varieties. A total of 130 inbred lines were grown in two regions in China, and 12,350 kernel samples were analyzed through NIR spectroscopy. Spectral differences among varieties, producing areas, ears, and ear positions were determined and compared on the basis of pretreated spectra. The bands at 1300-1470, 1768-1949, 2010-2064, and 2235-2311 nm were mainly affected by the producing area. Band selection and principal component analysis were applied to improve the influence of variety on NIR spectra by processing the pretreated spectra. The degrees of the influence of varieties, producing areas, ears, and ear positions were calculated, and the percentages of the influence of varieties, producing areas, ears, and ear positions were 45.40%, 42.66%, 8.22%, and 3.72%, respectively. Therefore, genetic differences among maize inbred lines are the main factors accounted for NIR spectral differences. Producing area is a secondary factor. These results could provide a reference for researchers who authenticate varieties, perform geographical origin traceabilities, and conduct maize seed breeding.

AB In the study, Fourier transform near infrared spectroscopy technology (FT-NIR) was adopted to protect a geographically iconic product, Baha Siber mung bean. Based on partial least squares analysis method, the origin-variety dual tracing model was firstly established. Then, the data of Baha Siber mung beans from four counties (Durbert Mongolian Autonomous County (Dumeng County for short) and Baicheng, Tailai and Chifeng) were processed with different preprocessing methods to establish the origin tracing model for the analysis and comparison. Among different preprocessing methods, the vector normalization preprocessing method yielded the higher precision of corresponding model (R-2 = 98.02). A variety identification model was established for five varieties: mung bean, Xiaoyinggelu, Dayinggelu, Lufeng 2 and Chilu 3 from Dumeng. The preprocessing method based on multivariate scattering correction yielded the higher precision (R-2 = 96.83). According to the partial least squares method-discriminant analysis results (PLS-DA), the correct recognition rate of Dumeng mung beans obtained with the origin tracing model was 92.31 %; the correct recognition rate of Xiaoming mung beans obtained with the variety identification model was 90.00 %; the correct recognition rate of Baha'sib mung obtained with the origin-variety dual tracing model was 96.67 %. Therefore, the origin-variety dual tracing model based on FT-NIR and PLS improved the correct recognition rate of Bahaxibo mung beans. This method provides a new brand protection way for geographical indication products of mung bean.It also provides a new strategy for the identification of other high value-added agricultural products.

AB The aged seeds have a significant influence on seed vigor and corn growth. Therefore, it is vital for the planting industry to identify aged seeds. In this study, hyperspectral reflectance imaging (1,000-2,000 nm) was employed for identifying aged maize seeds using seeds harvested in different years. The average spectra of the embryo side, endosperm side, and both sides were extracted. The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was used to develop classification models based on full spectra to evaluate the potential of hyperspectral imaging for maize seed detection and using the principal component analysis (PCA) and ANOVA to reduce data dimensionality and extract feature wavelengths. The classification models achieved perfect performance using full spectra with an accuracy of 100% for the prediction set. The performance of models established with the first three principal components was similar to full spectrum models, but that of PCA loading models was worse. Compared to other spectra, the two-band ratio (1,987 nm/1,079 nm) selected by ANOVA from embryo-side spectra achieved a better classification accuracy of 95% for the prediction set. The image texture features, including histogram statistics (HS) and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), were extracted from the two-band ratio image to establish fusion models. The results demonstrated that the two-band ratio selected from embryo-side spectra combined with image texture features achieved the classification of maize seeds harvested in different years with an accuracy of 97.5% for the prediction set. The overall results indicated that combining the two wavelengths with image texture features could detect aged maize seeds effectively. The proposed method was conducive to the development of multi-spectral detection equipment.

AB The field of food analytical chemistry has greatly evolved over the last years, moving from the descriptive view of raw food composition into the modern instrumental approaches known as the foodomics. The development and optimization of these integrated approaches, based on the use of high resolution techniques for tracing the chemical fingerprint of a food, is arriving to define molecular parameters for the qualification, authentication, and safety of the products. With these new tools, omics are solving some of the new issues of food quality and traceability, including the development of analytical methods to ensure the origin of food, as well as the discovery of biomarkers to identify potential food safety problems. Here we review the main methods used in foodomics from its birth until now, highlighting the use of high throughput instrumentation. This includes the computational problems they generate, but also the significant prospects for development of knowledge that are able to open in important areas such as food technology and biotechnology.

AB Background Royal jelly (RJ) represents the most valuable product of beekeeping activities. The illegal introduction of RJ of uncertain quality/origin in European agrofood markets is not controlled, since the conventional analytical methods cannot unambiguously distinguish foreign from autochthonous RJ products. Here, we applied liquid-state NMR spectroscopy combined with chemometry to characterize the metabolic profile of representative Italian high-quality RJ products and evaluate the discrimination capacity of this analytical technique.
   Materials and methods RJ samples were supplied by an Italian consortium of royal jellies producers and developed in the period May-July 2016. Samples were dissolved in a deuterated water solution brought at pH 7.3 and analysed through high resolution liquid-state NMR spectroscopy. 1D and 2D homo- and heteronuclear experiments were acquired to identify the RJ metabolomics profile. Proton NMR spectra were elaborated to conduct an NMR-based metabolomic approach based on PCA and DA chemometric analyses.
   Results The NMR-based metabolomics precisely and significantly (p value < 0.05, according to Benjamini-Hochberg's test) authenticated the RJ products, by reliably tracing both their geographical and botanical origin, as well as their production period. In particular, Chinese RJ products exhibited a larger amount of citrate and lysine, accompanied by a lower content of 10-HDA. Our results showed that NMR spectroscopy can recognize low-quality fraudulent products and become an useful analytical tool to certify and trace the RJ molecular composition.
   Conclusions The application of NMR spectroscopy promises to enable the efficient protection of both the producers and consumers of high-quality royal jelly. In addition, the proposed method may be used in combination with the conventional melissopalynological methods for recognizing frauds.

AB This study investigates the attitudes and perceptions of businesses and consumers towards the application of Blockchain technology (BCT) to fresh produce supply chains. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups (FG) were performed with fresh produce company managers and consumers, respectively. The fresh produce sector, in this context, concerns the fresh and chill chain, value-added vegetables, fruits and salads and the ingredients of these used in further food value-added processes and products. A total of five themes were identified as factors influencing BCT adoption: the novelty of the technology, supply chain characteristics, open data issues, cost-benefit analysis, and role of public stakeholders. From these, twelve sub-themes were developed and discussed. Findings provide a framework with opportunities and challenges that the fresh produce system must face in adopting decentralised systems for managing supply chain data like BCT.

AB Consumers have more and more interest in where and how their foods are produced. However, it is often challenging to discriminate products from different production locations and systems. The objective of this study was to examine fingerprinting of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as an approach for characterization and discrimination of tomatoes by their production location, production system, and variety using Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometry combined with multivariate statistics. Sensory analysis was complementing the VOC analyses. The study was part of the EU CORE Organic II project Authentic Food. Tomato sample batches cultivated in two locations in Italy, according to the organic and conventional production system, comprising two varieties, and produced in two consecutive years were examined. Both factors production location and production system impacted considerably the VOC fingerprints, but compared to these two factors, minor differences were observed between the two varieties of tomatoes studied. VOC data were successfully used to predict the origin and production system for this sample set. Sensory data also primarily indicated the differences between origin and production systems, and several sensory attributes could be predicted from the VOC fingerprints. Therefore, VOC fingerprints reflect production conditions and are promising for substantiation and authentication of special tomato traits.

AB Efficient and transparent water management in collective irrigation districts is the principal commitment of Water User Associations (WUAs), which manage 70% of the available water resources in Spain. This paper shows the role of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in the management of modernised WUAs. The Campo de Cartagena WUA, a pioneering institution that has been applying ICI's to irrigation district management in south-eastern Spain since 1999, was selected as the case study. We analysed the effects of Id's (including the Decision Support System, Geographical Information System, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System, Web and mobile applications) on both the performance of WUA management tasks and the farmers' adaptation to the new services. The main improvements in WUA management performance were a more efficient and equitable allocation of water resources, the establishment of water traceability, and the improvement in management transparency, avoiding conflicts and vandalism. The new Web and mobile services, provided 24 h a day 7 days a week, have been very well received by farmers. Data from 2012 show that 27% of farmers used Web applications for their irrigation management, reaching 63% in those farms with a surface area over 50 ha. This means that currently 52% of the water supplied by the WUA was managed on the Internet. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The suitability of near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy was assessed for predicting the initial internal quality of strawberries, and for discriminating between different classes of fruits produced by three different fertility management systems: conventional (C), organic based on input substitution (S), and organic based on manure and cover crop amendment (M). Reflectance spectra were acquired using a Fourier Transform (FT)-NIR spectrometer for 219 'Festival' strawberries (93 M, 96 S, and 30 C). Relevant wavelength ranges were identified by Bruker's OPUS software and elaborated in MATLAB. The partial least squares (PLS) SIMPLS algorithm was tested in prediction models for total soluble solids content (TSS), pH, titratable acidity (TA), ascorbic acid content, and phenolic content, while PLS-DA (DA = discriminant analysis) was used in the classification models. The intact strawberry spectra resulted in good predictions of TSS content (R-2 = 0.85; RMSEP = 0.58), pH (R-2=0.86; RMSEP = 0.09), and TA (R-2=0.58; RMSEP = 0.15). For the classification models, both sensitivity and specificity were >0.97 for external sample classes. In addition to being a valid approach for the selection of superior quality strawberries, the presented NIR methodology is expected to be a promising support for the traceability and authentication of organic produce.

AB A broad range of foods have been described as causing allergies, but the majority of allergic reactions can be ascribed to a limited number of food components. Recent extensive surveys showed how tree nuts, particularly hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) seeds, rank amongst the most important sources of food allergy. In order to protect the allergic consumer, efficient and reliable methods are required for the detection of allergenic ingredients. For this purpose, we have developed a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of hazelnut in commercial food products. In this way a specific hazelnut primer pair based on the ITS marker (70 bp) and a nuclease (TaqMan) probe labelled with FAM and BHQ were designed. Sensibility of real-time PCR was determined by analysis of raw and heat treated hazelnut-wheat flour mixtures with a range of detection of 0.1-100,000 ppm. Practical applicability of the real-time PCR assay developed for determining hazelnut in different food matrices was investigated by analyzing 179 commercial foodstuffs comprising snacks, biscuits, chocolates, bonbons, creams, nut bars, ice creams, precooked meals, breads, beverages, yogurts, cereals, meat products, rice cake and nougat. From the total of samples analyzed, 40 commercial food products that didn't declare hazelnut nor traces on the label were found to contain hazelnut. The real-time PCR method proposed herein due to its high sensitivity facilitates the detection of hazelnut traces in commercial food products and can also be useful for monitoring the effectiveness of cleaning processes and as consequence, can help to prevent the food allergic consumer from unintentional ingestion of hidden allergens.

AB 'Nebbiolo' (Vitis vinifera L.) is renowned for its use in producing monovarietal high-quality red wines, such Barolo and Barbaresco. The fight against fraud to safeguard high-quality productions requires an effective varietal identification system applicable in musts and wines. 'Nebbiolo'-specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified starting from available databases and 260 genotypes analysed by Vitis18kSNP array. Two SNPs were sufficient to identify 'Nebbiolo' from 1157 genotypes. The SNP TaqMan (R) genotyping assays developed in this work successfully identified 'Nebbiolo' in all musts and wines collected at different experimental wine-making steps. The high sensitivity of the assays allowed identification of must mixtures at 1% and wine mixtures at 10-20% with non-'Nebbiolo' genotypes. In commercial wines, the amplification efficiency was limited by the low amount of grapevine DNA and the presence of PCR inhibitors. The TaqMan (R) genotyping assay is a rapid, highly sensitive and specific methodology with remarkable potential for varietal identification in wines.

AB The emerging botanical and native food industries have enormous potential for the development and delivery of authentic, delicious and unique foods and ingredients. The definition of provenance (e.g. authenticity, geographical origin) is of primary importance for these emerging food industries to gain access into different local and international markets. For example, the production of native food ingredients in Australia is based on the knowledge of the native flora (more than 25,0000 native species), local traditions and uses that might provide with new opportunities for the development and selection of new alternative ingredients and products. Overall, the utilization of these unique food ingredients is contributing with the development of new, attractive, delicious, healthy and nutritious foods. However, one important aspect of their utilization is the one associated with their provenance. Therefore, the definition, evaluation and understanding of provenance will provide with several economic advantages to the custodians and producers of this type of natural and plant ingredients.

AB Conventional battery powered and rigid wireless electronic systems are needed to be improved for adapting to the actual food quality and safety monitoring. This paper aims to propose and develop a flexible battery-free wireless electronic system (FBES) for food monitoring by the laser direct scribing on commercial polyethylene terephthalate/polyimide/copper (PET/PI/Cu) film. The FBES could acquire the temperature, weighing and pH sensor data, and transmit to the wireless reader by radio frequency identification/near field communication (RFID/NFC) with 13.56 MHz. The FBES could harvest the RF energy from the wireless reader and battery-free power for the food sensors and sensor acquisition module. The surface microscope image of the flexible Cu circuit demonstrated that the laser direct scribing could be easily applied to fabricate the flexible electronic system with low complex process and low cost. The food temperature, moisture loss rate (MLR) and pH monitoring applications have been evaluated. The application evaluation results demonstrated that the proposed FBES has a potential application for many kinds of food monitoring by harvesting the RF energy with continuous or ondemand. It could improve transparency and guarantee the quality and safety of food. (C) 2022 Vietnam National University, Hanoi. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is beginning to live up to its promise of delivering real value, driven by recent advances in the availability of relevant data, computation and algorithms. In the present paper, I discuss the value to agriculture from AI over the next decade. The more immediate applications will be to improve precision information about what is happening on the farm by improving what is being detected and measured. A consequence of this are more accurate alerts to farmers. Another is an increased ability to understand why phenomena occur in farm systems, so as to improve their management. From improved data and understanding come improved predictions, enabling more optimal decisions about how to manage farm systems and stimulating the development of decision support and recommender systems. In many cases, robotics and automated systems will remove much of the need for human decision-making and improve farm efficiencies and farm health. Artificial intelligence will also be needed to enable organisations to harness the value of information distributed throughout supply chains, including farm data. Digital twins will also emerge as an important paradigm to improve how information about farm entities is organised to support decision-making. There are also likely to be negative impacts from AI, such as disruption to the roles and skills needed from farm workers, indicating the need to consider the social and ethical impacts of AI each time a new capability is introduced. I conclude that understanding these challenges more deeply tends to highlight new opportunities for positive change.

AB Chemometric methods using stable isotopes and elemental fingerprinting were used to characterize organically grown rice from green and conventionally grown rice in experimental field trials in China. Carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen stable isotopes as well as 26 other elements were determined. Organic rice was found to be more depleted in C-13 than green or conventionally grown rice because of the uptake of enriched C-13 from carbon dioxide and methane respiring bacteria and more enriched in N-15 because of the volatilization of the nitrogen from the urea and ammonium of the animal manures used to manufacture the organic composts. Chemometrics (principal-component analysis and linear-discriminant analysis) were used to separate the three farming methods and provided a promising scientific tool to authenticate the farming methods of different rice cultivars fertilized with animal manures, green composts, and synthetic fertilizers in China or elsewhere.

AB Multielement analysis and chemometric methods were proposed to discriminate the Sorrento lemon (PGI) juices according to geographical origin. In 2018 and 2019, 169 fruits from three farms in PGI area and two in not-PGI area were collected and analysed for essential and not-essential elements by ICP-MS. The PCA of multielement fingerprinting grouped lemon juices from PGI farms revealing a strong differentiation at small geographical scale. The S-LDA discriminated lemon juices for Mo, Ba, Rb, Mg, Co, Ca, Fe, Sr on the two production years, giving 97.7% correct classification, 98.5% accuracy and 93.8% external validation. The good correlation lemon juice vs cultivation soil and the soil discrimination by not-essential elements suggested the use of these elements as reliable indicators of lemon juice provenances. Despite lowering the number of variables, constituted by notessential elements Ba, Rb, Ti, Co, the use of S-QDA discriminated the lemons juices with 87.5% accuracy and 83.9% validation.

AB This paper systematically investigates the impact of consumers' health risk perceptions on the purchase intention of blockchain traceable fresh fruits in China. It uses online-survey data collected from four pilot cities that are part of the food traceability system in China. The ordinary least squares (OLS) and the ordered probit model was applied to examine the posited relationships. The results show that consumers' health risk perception has a significant positive effect on the purchase intention of blockchain traceable fresh fruits. The stronger consumers' health risk perception, the stronger their purchase intention of blockchain traceable fresh fruits. Likewise, heterogeneity exists among gender, age, income, and education in their corresponding effect of consumers' health risk perception on blockchain traceable fresh fruit purchase intention. This suggests that male, high-aged, high-income and high-educated groups have a higher health risk perception, and therefore a higher purchase perception for blockchain traceable fresh fruits than female, low-aged, low-income and low-educated, respectively. Furthermore, family structure, consumers' traceability cognition and purchase experience of traceable products affect the purchase intention of blockchain traceable fresh fruits. The study has several insights on the broader promotion, acceptance and development of the food traceability system and provides practical cues for policy and practice.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) results in a massive amount of streaming data, often referred to as "big data," which brings new opportunities to monitor agricultural and food processes. Besides sensors, big data from social media is also becoming important for the food industry. In this review, we present an overview of IoT, big data, and artificial intelligence (AI), and their disruptive role in shaping the future of agri-food systems. Following an introduction to the fields of IoT, big data, and AI, we discuss the role of IoT and big data analysis in agriculture (including greenhouse monitoring, intelligent farm machines, and drone-based crop imaging), supply chain modernization, social media (for open innovation and sentiment analysis) in food industry, food quality assessment (using spectral methods and sensor fusion), and finally, food safety (using gene sequencing and blockchain-based digital traceability). A special emphasis is laid on the commercial status of applications and translational research outcomes.

TI Mapping the pork value chain in Vietnam: a systematic review

DT Review
DE Pig; Pork value chain; Traceability; Food safety; Vietnam; Review
ID PIG PRODUCTION SYSTEMS; TRACEABILITY
AB In Vietnam, pork is the most commonly consumed type of meat, and the demand is expected to rise even further. Nevertheless, food safety is a major concern, as the country bears a high burden of food-borne diseases, including these caused by pork products. Knowledge of the flows of pigs and pork from producers up to the consumers is important; however, up to now, a comprehensive overview is lacking. We addressed this by conducting a systematic review on the pork value chain (PVC) mapping for the country. Four international and three Vietnamese databases were searched for data on the pork value chain in Vietnam, and the results were reported according to the PRISMA guidelines. Data obtained from the retained records showed that 10 main PVC types are present in Vietnam, comprising of five main actors including: producers, middlemen, slaughter men, retailers and consumers. Among the identified chains, the one involving producers, slaughter men, retailers and consumers is the most common one, with up to 75% of pork following this route. In cities or export routes to other countries, middlemen and/or traders are important additional actors in the PVCs. The small scale of PVC linkages is prominent. The presence of middlemen, pig traders and pork traders is contributing to further distribution of pork products in geographical terms. Transactions between actors in the traditional PVCs in Vietnam are characterized by the absence of official contracts; therefore, the linkages in the chains are loose and the origin of pork is not traceable. More industrial forms of PVCs are slowly developing; however, the traditional PVCs are still prevailing in Vietnam. The weak linkages between actors and poor hygienic practices in these chains form a risk to pork safety.

AB Vulnerability assessment has been used in the food fraud mitigation based on the subjective judgement of industry participants and simple calculation. To have a more objective result, an improved vulnerability quantitative assessment method was proposed. The overall fraud vulnerability was described by the vulnerability of fraud factors and the health and economic impact of fraud incidents. The fraud factors were related to opportunity, motivation and control measure. Analytic hierarchy process combined with entropy weighting method (AHP-EWM) and artificial neural networking (ANN) to improve judgment accuracy. In the application in Wuchang rice industrial chain, 51 fraud factors were used in the assessment and 10 experts, 36 farmers, 15 suppliers and 15 supervisors were interviewed. Results showed that Wuchang rice industrial chain was highly vulnerable to fraud. The opportunity for fraud was high, the motivation to commit it was moderate, and controls to prevent it needed reinforcing. Fraud vulnerability differed between farmers and suppliers. To reduce the fraud vulnerability, improved regulations and policies and stiffer penalties were strongly recommended.

ID SYSTEM
AB Since the beginning of the 1990s, modern agriculture and farming has changed dramatically. Agriculture has become a high-tech industry. With the possibility for locating agricultural machinery in the field using satellite positioning technologies (Global Navigation Satellite Systems, GNSS) and the increasing availability of geographic information in digital form and in increasing quality, farmers are now able to measure the spatial and temporal variability in soil, vegetation, relief, etc. within a field and to modify their operations to react to this. Farmers keep electronic field records and farm diaries, which they are able to use on-site with a PDA in order to enter or retrieve information. Agricultural machinery is also being continuously developed, since due to the in-field heterogeneity many different operations (from yield mapping to plant protection) are performed on-site and logged so that they may be later evaluated by computer. Due to legal regulations (IACS, cross-compliance, traceability, quality management, etc.), GIS (and GeoWeb services) and information-driven crop production are becoming normal tools in agriculture, which must be integrated into usual farm practices.

ID INFRARED-SPECTROSCOPY
AB Edible bird's nest (EBN) is widely consumed in South-East Asia as a health food product. In recent years, the adulteration of EBN is quite common due to its high economic value and limited supplies of the natural authentic product. Authentication and traceability of EBN demands time-consuming sequential analytical measurements to confirm that the product quality meets technical and regulatory requirements. Mid Infrared spectroscopy combined with chemometric analysis by Data-Driven Soft Independent Modelling of Class Analogy (DD-SIMCA) was used in this study to screen Malaysian EBNs for structural adulterants and for confirmation of geographical origin. The samples used were authentic processed EBNs of different grades (2A, 3A, 4A and 5A) from the swiftlet species Aerodramus fuciphagus supplied by Ministry of Health, Malaysia. Similarly, adulterants commonly used in EBN namely agar, Karaya gum, bovine gelatin, fish skin, melamine and porcine gelatine were also characterized. Adulterant mixtures were prepared gravimetrically at concentrations of 1, 5 and 10%w/w by combining appropriate quantities of adulterants with individual authentic EBN samples. Samples were then analyzed by Mid-Infrared - Attenuated Total Reflectance (MIR-ATR) spectroscopy. All test samples are properly categorized as members of the target class. However, 61% of the tested adulterated EBNs were correctly classified as 'alien' or non-authentic samples. The sensitivity and specifity values for DD-SIMCA models applied to origin determination ranged from 90 to 100% for production regions from Kelantan, Perak and Malacca. MIR-ATR spectroscopy in combination with DD-SIMCA modelling has shown potential as a rapid screening technique to detect the presence adulterants and confirm the provenance of EBN produced in Malaysia. Further work is required to validate the approach with a larger set of authentic samples and for a wider range of adulterants including flavour enhancers and preservatives.

AB BACKGROUND: The origin of the raw spirits influences the sensory quality of rectified spirits that are subsequently used for the production of vodka. The aim of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of two methods based on the comparison of profiles of volatile compounds [solid phase microextractiongas chromatographymass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS) and gas chromatography with flame ionisation detection (GC-FID)] for the determination of origin of raw spirits obtained from rye, corn (maize) and potato. RESULTS: Profiles obtained for the volatile compounds by using these methods were different and were influenced by the sample introduction method. The main groups of volatiles obtained using SPME-GC-MS method were fatty acid ethyl esters, while in the case of GC-FID fusel alcohols and ethyl acetate dominated. Data obtained from these methods were treated using principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis to test the possibility of sample differentiation and classification. It was relatively easy to differentiate potato spirits from the remainder; however, it was not possible to fully distinguish the corn samples from rye samples. The classification ability of the SPME-GC-MS method was 95% but the prediction ability was 97.4%. For the GC-FID method the classification ability was 90.1%, whereas the prediction ability was 94.27%. CONCLUSIONS: The methods presented can be used for reliable differentiation of potato spirits from corn and rye spirits. Copyright (C) 2012 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Innovative application of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for rapid and nondestructive analyses has been gaining increasing attention for food safety and quality. SERS is based on inelastic scattering enhancement from molecules located near nanostructured metallic surfaces and has many advantages, including ultrasensitive detection and simple protocols. Current SERS-based quality analysis contains composition and structural information that can be used to establish an electronic file of the food samples for subsequent reference and traceability. SERS is a promising technique for the detection of chemical, biological, and harmful metal contaminants, as well as for food poisoning, and allergen identification using label-free or label-based methods, based on metals and semiconductors as substrates. Recognition elements, including immunosensors, aptasensors, or molecularly imprinted polymers, can be linked to SERS tags to specifically identify targeted contaminants and perform authenticity analysis. Herein, we highlight recent studies on SERS-based quality and safety analysis for different foods categories spanning the whole food chain, 'from farm to table' and processing, genetically modified food, and novel foods. Moreover, SERS detection is a potential tool that ensures food safety in an easy, rapid, reliable, and nondestructive manner during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB This study investigated the effects of four autochthonous yeast strains and one commercial strain of Saccharo-myces cerevisiae on the volatile and chemical profiles of rose acute accent and sparkling wines (Bombino cultivar). HPLC-HRMS, GC-MS, and odorant series analyses were performed on sparkling wine produced on an industrial scale. Statistical elaboration of GC-MS and HPLC-HRMS data suggested that the adoption of autochthonous yeast strains significantly influenced the composition of sparkling wines in terms of volatile and non-volatile com-pounds. A correlation analysis was performed on the GC-MS and HPLC-HRMS data to determine a pool of compounds for discrimination of winemaking processes using native versus commercial yeast strains.The results indicated a significant strain-specific effect of the autochthonous yeast strains on the aroma and metabolome of regional sparkling wines compared to the commercial strain. This study may provide stakeholders with a powerful tool suitable to bring innovation and market differentiation.

AB A simple, rapid and accurate detection method for the authentication of animal species is urgently required in the food detection field. The present study established a horse-specific polymerase chain reaction integrated with a lateral flow sensor assay (Horse-PCR-LFS) for the rapid detection of horse meat. In this test, a cytb gene sequence of horse was amplified using PCR, the PCR amplicon was checked with the lateral flow sensor assay, and the result of the sensor can be read within 2-3 min by the naked eye. The detection limit of the test was up to 0.01% horse meat in artificially adulterated meat mixtures, the assay also successfully detected horse DNA in various commercial food samples. As a rapid and user-friendly molecular detection tool, this test provides an accurate detection format for the identification of horse and offers solutions to problems related to animal meat adulteration and animal-origin food safety and traceability.

AB Molecular characterization of genetically modified plants can provide crucial information for the development of detection and identification methods, to comply with traceability, and labeling requirements prior to commercialization. Detailed description of the genetic modification was previously a challenging step in the safety assessment, since it required the use of laborious and time-consuming techniques. In this study an accurate, simple, and fast method was developed for molecular characterization of genetically modified (GM) plants, following a user-friendly workflow for researchers with limited bioinformatic capabilities. Three GM events from a diverse array of crop species-perennial ryegrass, white clover, and canola-were used to test the approach that exploits long-read sequencing by the MinION device, from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. The method delivered a higher degree of resolution of the transgenic events within the host genome than has previously been possible with the standard Illumina short-range sequencing strategies. The flanking sequences, copy number, and presence of backbone sequences, and overall transgene insertion structure were determined for each of the plant genomes, with the additional identification of moderate-sized secondary insertions that would have previously been missed. The proposed workflow takes only about 1 week from DNA extraction to analyzed result, and the method will complement the existing approaches for molecular characterization of GM plants, since it makes the process faster, simpler, and more cost-effective.

AB Based on a modified quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe (QuEChERS) sample preparation method with Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) as the adsorbing material and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) determination in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, we established a new method for the determination of multiple pesticides in vegetables and fruits. It was determined that bare MNPs have excellent function as adsorbent when purified, and it is better to be separated from the extract. The amount of MNPs influenced the clean-up performance and recoveries. To achieve the optimum performance of modified QuEChERS towards the target analytes, several parameters including the amount of the adsorbents and purification time were investigated. Under the optimum conditions, recoveries were evaluated in four representative matrices (tomato, cucumber, orange and apple) with the spiked concentrations of 10 mu g kg(-1), 50 mu g kg(-1) and 200 mu g kg(-1) in all cases. The results showed that the recovery of 101 pesticides ranged between 71.5 and 111.7%, and the relative standard deviation was less than 10.5%. The optimum clean-up system improved the purification efficiency and simultaneously obtained satisfactory recoveries of multiple pesticides, including planar-ring pesticides. In short, the modified QuEChERS method in addition to MNPs used for removing impurities improved the speed of sample pre-treatment and exhibited an enhanced performance and purifying effect.

AB A specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was applied for identification of bovine (Bos taurus), ovine (Ovis aries) and caprine (Capra hircus) pure and binary mixtures of raw and heat-processed meats. These meats are used in food industry products and/or for direct consumption of consumers. The mitochondrial DNA was amplified as a template in a PCR reaction by use of specific primers related to each species. Specific primers with mitochondrial origin amplified amplicons with the length of 300, 172 and 122 bp in target regions in cattle, sheep and goat, respectively. For determination of the primer sensitivity a set of binary meat mixtures with 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100% based on weight ratio was tested. The detection limit was found to be 0.1% for all samples. In heat-processing program boiled water for 20 min, 121 degrees C for 20 and 30 mm and 127 degrees C for 20 min by autoclaving was used, similar to the conditions that are used in pasteurization, sterilization and also meat processing in industrial factories. The performance of the method was not affected by prolonged heat treatments. The results obtained in the present study confirmed the efficiency of species specific primers for targeting of mitochondrial genome in order to detect bovine, ovine and caprine pure and binary mixtures of raw and heat processed meats with high sensitivity and accuracy.

AB Modern-day agriculture supply chains have evolved from sovereign and autonomous local stakeholders to a worldwide interconnected system of multiple participants linked by complicated interactions, impacting the production, processing, transportation, and delivery of food to end consumers. Regular instances of fraudulent acts reveal a lack of openness in agriculture supply chains, raising worries about financial losses, eroding customer trust, and lowering corporate brand value. To develop an efficient and reliable trading environment, several fundamental modifications in the present supply chain architecture are required. There is broad consensus that blockchain can improve transparency in agriculture-food supply chains (agri-food SCs). Consumers now demand safe, sustainable, and equitable food production processes, and businesses are using blockchains and the internet of things to meet these needs. For enhanced responsiveness in agri-food SCs, new concepts have evolved that combine blockchains with various Industry 5.0 technologies (e.g., blockchain technology, big data, internet of things (IoT), radio frequency identification (RFID), near field communication (NFC), etc.). It is critical to cut through the hype and examine the technology's limits, which might stymie its acceptance, implementation, and scalability in agri-food supply chains. This study presents Agri-SCM-BIoT (Agriculture Supply Chain Management using Blockchain and Internet of things) architecture to address the storage and scalability optimization, interoperability, security and privacy issues security, and privacy of personal data along with storage concerns with present single-chain agriculture supply chain systems. We also discussed the classification of security threats with IoT infrastructure and possible available blockchain-based defense mechanisms. Finally, we discussed the features of the proposed supply chain architecture, followed by a conclusion and future work.

AB The identification of individuals' breed of origin has several practical applications in livestock and is useful in different biological contexts such as conservation genetics, breeding and authentication of animal products. In this paper, penalized multinomial regression was applied to identify the minimum number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from high-throughput genotyping data for individual assignment to dairy sheep breeds reared in Sicily. The combined use of penalized multinomial regression and stability selection reduced the number of SNPs required to 48. A final validation step on an independent population was carried out obtaining 100% correctly classified individuals. The results using independent analysis, such as admixture, F-st, principal component analysis and random forest, confirmed the ability of these methods in selecting distinctive markers. The identified SNPs may constitute a starting point for the development of a SNP based identification test as a tool for breed assignment and traceability of animal products.

AB The main chemical parameters such as content of sugar (glucose and fructose), organic acid (total acids, malic and tartaric acids), total phenolics and the antioxidant activity in 9 dry white wines with PDO of 3 varieties (Pinot Blanc, Riesling, Sauvignon blanc) from 3 countries (Slovakia, Hungary, Austria) were studied in this work in order to identify possible differences in their quality affected by geographical origin. The wine samples were examined by the FTIR and spectrophotometry methods (TPC and DPPH). As supporting parameters, alcohol and glycerol content were used and sensory evaluation of wines was performed. For the statistical evaluation were used ANOVA and PCA methods. Austrian wines in general, were characterized by high glucose and fructose content, high TPC and antioxidant activity. Higher results of these parameters are characteristic especially for the Austrian varieties Pinot blanc and Sauvignon blanc which originated from the same wine-region in Austria. Sauvignon variety from Slovakia was characterized by higher total acid content, especially in the case of tartaric acid. Statistical evaluation was helpful to show several differences, especially in the case of PCA application. Just Riesling variety from all countries of origin was so similar that it was not possible to be strictly distinguished using PCA. Wines from Hungary (Sauvignon and Pinot blanc) showed higher content of alcohol and glycerol, as they are produced by the sugar fermentation. Wines from Slovakia were evaluated as the best samples among selected ones within their sensory evaluation.

AB Traceability is the ability to follow the displacement of food through its entire chain. Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) represents Italian excellence, with consumers' increased awareness for traceability. The aim of this work is to propose and analyze the economic sustainability and consumers' preference of three technological systems supporting traceability: Near Field Communication (NFC) based; tamper-proof device plus Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and app; QR code tag plus "scratch and win" system and blockchain. An anonymous questionnaire to Italian consumers (n = 1120) was made to acquire consumers' acceptability of the systems and estimating their willingness to pay additional premium prices for these. An economic analysis estimated and compared the technology costs at different production levels. Results show that 94% of the consumer respondents are interested in the implementation of such technologies, and among them 45% chose QR-code protected by a "scratch-and-win" system with a blockchain infotracing-platform (QR-B). The consumers interested are willing to pay a mean premium price of 17.8% and economic analysis reported evidenced an incidence always lower than mid-/high-production levels. The success of the QR-B could be ascribed to different aspects: the cutting-edge fashion trend of blockchain in the food sector, the use of incentives, the easy-to-use QR-code, and the gamification strategy.

AB The need for global feed supply traceability, the high-throughput testing demands of feed industry, and regulatory enforcement drive the need for feed analysis and make extremely complex the issue of the control and evaluation of feed quality, safety, and functional properties, all of which contribute to the very high number of analyses that must be performed. Feed analysis, with respect to animal nutritional requirements, health, reproduction, and production, should be multianalytically approached. In addition to standard methods of chemical analysis, new methods for evaluation of feed composition and functional properties, authenticity, and safety have been developed. Requirements for new analytical methods emphasize performance, sensitivity, reliability, speed, simplified use, low cost for high volume, and routine assays. This review provides an overview of the most used and promising methods for feed analysis. The review is intentionally focused on the following techniques: classical chemical analysis; in situ and in vitro methods; analytical techniques coupled with chemometric tools (NIR and sensors); and cell-based bioassays. This review describes both the potential and limitations of each technique and discusses the challenges that need to be overcome to obtain validated and standardized methods of analysis for a complete and global feed evaluation and characterization.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the viability of using transponders for the electronic identification of water buffaloes and compare their efficiency when used in animals of different age groups. Electronic transponders with RFID technology (2.1 x 12.2 mm) were implanted subcutaneously (D0) in the scutiform cartilage. The animals consisted of four groups: CLF-I (17 calves; 2.1 +/- 1.9 months), CLF-II (20 calves; 5.1 +/- 3.2 months), HFR (20 heifers; 22 +/- 4.7 months) and STR (19 steers; 26.6 +/- 6.7 months). The animals were kept under pasture grazing, a part of the year in the dryland and a part in the floodplain, and were monitored for up to 350 days. The average time required for individual transponder implant was 49.46 s, while the time required for reading the code was 3.76 s. The older calves required higher time for individual implant (P = 0.0001) and closer approximation of the reader in the D150 (P = 0.0001). The mean read distance was 2.98 cm in D0 and 1.94 cm in D150. The magnitude of the subcutaneous transponder migration was minimal, and was within an area of 17.2 mm(2). A slight bleeding was observed in 15.79% of the animals during the implant. A decreasing incidence of edema was observed until D21, with the heifers being more sensitive until that time (P = 0.0099). Considering the results, it is preferred to implant electronic transponders in calves up to two months of age. The physical rate of transponder loss was 1.3% and the loss of functionality was 9.2%. High reading rate was achieved when animals were raised both in dryland (93.9%) and floodplain (97.2%). Thus, the electronic identification of water buffaloes is a technique capable of replacing traditional and rudimentary methods to identify buffaloes and can provide safe identification of animals.

AB The expansion of the food industry, within and beyond national borders, has resulted in complex collaborative networks and supply chains. The management culture adopted for food supply chains has an impact on the quality of the end product and the vitality of the businesses involved. In this report, we focus on the use of blockchain technology, and distributed ledgers in general, for managing supply chains in the food and agricultural sectors. We explore the challenges with which typical management systems are faced, such as food safety, food fraud, and inefficient processes, as well as ethical aspects like fair trade, animal welfare, and the environmental impact of food production. The use of blockchain-based systems for managing a supply chain offers significant benefits, such as faster and more reliable traceability. Our analysis, involving small and medium enterprises (SMEs) from Denmark, highlights that SMEs could benefit from blockchain-based systems that encourage fair trade and authenticity documentation, expose good practices, and decrease management costs. However, due to a lack of important policies and standards, and due to the limited understanding of the technology itself, its large-scale adoption is at the moment immature.

AB The adverse effects of increased nitrate (NO3-) pollution especially from the non-point source on the hydrosphere and anthroposphere are becoming more prominent. The non-point-derived NO3- in the rivers supplying the upstream threatens the aquatic ecosystem of Taihu Lake. Here, dual-stable isotopes (delta N-15 and delta O-18) of NO3- were applied to the Bayesian model (SIAR) for quantitative source identification of reactive nitrogen (Nr) in a mixed agricultural and urban region along the complex river network of the Yangze River delta. The results showed that the NO3- concentrations in the rivers ranged from 1.09 to 4.44 mg L-1 and decreased from the highly urbanized areas to the lakeside rural areas. The specific isotopic characteristics of four sources (atmospheric deposition, AD; chemical fertilizer, CF; manure and sewage, MS; and soil leachate, SL) by the SIAR isotope model indicated that the MS source made the greatest contribution (46.56%) to the total NO3- load, followed by SL (27.86%), CF (23.77%), and AD (1.81%). The highly urbanized areas and the hybrid areas, which contained a mix of industrialized, populated, and agricultural areas, were identified as hotspot areas with heavy Nr pollution, responsible for spatial patterns of delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3-. These hotspot areas were characterized by a less well-developed sewage pipeline system with high Nr emissions from cash crops. The changes in wastewater treatment level, the agricultural production structure, and meteorological changes were the main factors of spatial variation of Nr concentration and source in the upstream Taihu Lake Basin. The variation in Nr concentration across Taihu Lake would respond to these anthropogenic-driven Nr loads. These findings suggest that MS was the predominant source had the strongest effect on the overall riverine NO3- source which was the primary problem that needed to be solved.

AB Introduction: Smallholder organic food processing contributes to an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable food system. It is important to know the profile and potential difficulties of organic food processors, organized under the modality of the Participatory Organic Quality Assurance System, due to its growth and social relevance for targeting actions and public policies with the consequent strengthening of agriculture with an agroecological basis. Objective: Describe the profile of organic food processors in Rio de Janeiro state and identify the main challenges in the production and commercialization schemes. Method: This is an exploratory and descriptive study with transversal design developed by documental research of different documents: handling plans, good practices manual, minutes of the Participatory Organic Quality Assurance System, certificates issued by the Association of Biological Farmers of the State of Rio de Janeiro, and other updated documents of the Participative Organism of Organic Conformity Assessment related to the accredited producers. Results: Sixty per cent of the organic processors in the Rio de Janeiro state were linked to the Participatory Organic Quality Assurance System. The processing unit mostly used is the one attached to their homes. Most of them are farmers or family micro-entrepreneurs that have assistance of family members in the production process and the main activity carried out is the production of canned foods, jams, sauces, and homemade desserts. Less than 70% of the producers had an operation permit and sanitary license, 97% had an Organic Handling Plan; 79% had a Good Practices Manual and 78% had a Traceability Plan. Among the main difficulties, there were: raw resource acquisition, sanitary rules adequacy and logistics in supplies. Conclusions: The study demonstrated the potentiality of organic products processing for the local social and economic development, and the need of greater inducements to make an inclusive production of small enterprises feasible.

AB BACKGROUND Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy coupled with principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) regression was used to analyse a series of different Irish Whiskey samples in order to define their spectral profile and to assess the capability of the NIR method to identify samples based on their origin and storage (e.g. distiller, method of maturation). The ability of NIR spectroscopy to quantify the level of potential chemical adulterants was also investigated. Samples were spiked with 0.1%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0% v/v of each adulterant (e.g. methanol, ethyl acetate, etc.) prior to NIR analysis.
   RESULTS The results of this study demonstrated the capability of NIR spectroscopy combined with PLS regression to classify the whiskey samples and to determine the level of adulteration. Moreover, the potential of NIR coupled with chemometric analysis as a rapid, portable, and non-destructive screening tool for quality control, traceability, and food/beverage adulteration for customs and other regulatory agencies, to mitigate beverage fraud was illustrated.
   CONCLUSION Given the non-specificity of the NIR technique, these positive preliminary results indicated that this method of analysis has the potential to be applied to identify the level of adulteration in distilled spirits. The rapid nature of the technique and lack of consumables or sample preparation required allows for a far more time and cost-effective analysis per sample. (c) 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB The enforcement of GMO labeling regulations requires validated analytical methods and certified reference materials (CRMs). The early labeling regulations stipulated that the GMO content should be expressed as percentage, but did not specify what unit this percentage referred to. Two reference systems, using mass fraction and copy number ratio as measurement units, individually, are established for GMO analysis using different metrological traceability chains. Three types of CRMs, powder CRMs certified for mass fractions, genomic DNA CRMs, and plasmid DNA CRMs certified for copy number ratios, were developed for calibration and quality control. The type, certification, and measurement unit commutability of current GMO CRMs are presented and discussed in this paper. Both existing reference systems are facing a metrological challenge, although later EU regulations specified that the measurement unit of GMO content must be expressed in mass fraction and recommended to convert one unit into another by introducing a conversion factor, further efforts are required to explore which reference system is more metrologically sound. The determination of conversion factor per CRM batch is recommended to be based on the pure CRMs produced from pure GM materials, which is expected to be the best choice for calibration of PCR measurement results.

AB BACKGROUND Apples have a leading role in the Italian fruit sector, and high-quality apples, including the Golden Delicious variety, are cultivated mainly in the Northern mountain districts. In the present study, Golden Delicious apples from PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) and PGI (Protected Geographical Indication) cultivation districts were characterized according to their Sr isotope composition and compared with apples from other Northern Italian districts.
   RESULTS Apples collected in two consecutive years (2017 and 2018) confirmed the low annual variability of the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio. The isotope ratio of apples was highly correlated with that of the soil extracts of the respective orchards. Statistical differences were highlighted between cultivation districts. However, because similar geological features characterized some areas, their ratios overlapped and a complete separation of the districts was not possible.
   CONCLUSION The Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio is an excellent marker for studies of food traceability because it retains the information about the place of origin. However, its strength is limited when comparing products from cultivation areas sharing similar geological features. In the perspective of geographical traceability, a multichemical characterization can overcome the limits of single-parameter approach. (c) 2020 The Authors.

AB BACKGROUNDFood traceability becomes lifesaving for persons suffering severe allergy or intolerance, and therefore need a complete avoidance of the immune-trigger food. This paper describes how to fingerprint the presence of some allergenic species (kiwi, peach, and apple) in foods by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR).
   RESULTSFive DNA extraction procedures were tested on fruits and foods. The results were statistically evaluated, and discussed. Analysis by qPCR with SYBR Green was developed to detect traces of these allergenic species in foods. Plasmids containing the target sequences of kiwi, peach and apple were employed as internal reference standard. Analysis of spiked food samples showed a limit of detection of 25mg kg(-1) for kiwi, 20mg kg(-1) for peach and 50mg kg(-1) for apple.
   CONCLUSIONThe qPCR method here developed, combined with the use of internal plasmid reference standard, represents a specific system for the quick detection of allergenic species in complex food matrices, with a limit of detection comparable with those reported using more time-consuming methods.

AB Amomum tsao-ko Crevost et Lemaire is a well-known dietary spice in the world for its unique flavor and medicinal effects. Nevertheless, the geographical origin of A. tsao-ko fruits plays a key role in affecting their aroma of cooking food and medicinal effects. This study attempted to investigate the prospects of using two dimensional correlation spectra (2DCOS) and image analysis methods for tracing the origins of A. tsao-ko fruits. To this goal, the near infrared (NIR) spectra of 439 A. tsao-ko fruits collected from 6 regions were obtained and converted into synchronous and asynchronous 2DCOS images. On this basis, two image analysis methods, including Red-GreenBlue (RGB) image analysis and residual convolutional neural network (Resnet) analysis, were applied for authenticating the geographical origin. The results of two image classification models indicated that synchronous 2DCOS images were more suitable to discriminate the geographical origins of A. tsao-ko fruits than asynchronous 2DCOS images. Furthermore, the comparison of categorized result between two image classification models suggested that Resnet model could not only automatically extract features from raw data but also provide more better discriminate model. Therefore, synchronous 2DCOS images combined Resnet analysis could be used as a reliable method for quality control of spice and herb.

AB One of the key concerns in meat supply chains is to provide chain-wide transparency, whereby food operators capture and share transparency data across the supply chain. To meet this concern a chain-wide transparency software system is needed that is able to address the desired stakeholder requirements. Unfortunately, designing and implementing a chain-wide transparency system is not straightforward. In this paper we provide a systematic approach for designing and implementing chain wide transparency systems. To this end, we first present a reference architecture that represents a generic design of such systems. Secondly, we discuss the systematic approach for deriving concrete architectures from the reference architecture based on stakeholders' requirements. Finally, we illustrate our approach with the design and implementation of a transparency system for beef supply chains. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cotton requires multiple processing steps to convert the raw agricultural products into finished textiles. Genetic and environmental factors, crop management decisions, and processing practices interact to affect optimal end use, product quality, and process efficiency. Currently, only limited data sharing occurs between sectors of the cotton industry, primarily the official USDA classing data used to determine the value of cotton bales. Increasing digitization could improve productivity, sustainability, and competitiveness with synthetic fibers. Current research has focused on utilizing RFID technology incorporated in a recently introduced harvest system for logistics and associating cotton fiber quality with field locations. Gins and textile mills use some connected sensors; however, their use is primarily limited to remote monitoring and diagnostics.In the future cotton industry, a much larger number of connected devices and sensors can provide information on the production and processing history of raw materials. Developments in agricultural robotics will offer a platform for measuring yield and quality on a site-specific basis in the field. Additional networked sensors and devices at gins and textile mills will provide additional information on product quality and process efficiency. Networking these connected devices will allow for the development of advanced analytics for optimizing logistics and processing industry-wide. Several challenges must be addressed to successfully implement IoT devices in the cotton industry. Improved rural broadband access and more suitable wireless networking protocols for field sensors are needed, although recently introduced technology may offer potential solutions. The cotton industry needs to develop appropriate data standards and data sharing policies. Integrating these data sources creates a new management paradigm, but research will be needed to optimally use this data.

AB Early ethics assessment of technological innovations promises to produce greater sensitivity to the potential for unfair impacts and problems of consent and distrust, yet faces a key challenge: ethical issues are hard to consider in advance. For technology, Collingridge (1980) describes a dilemma in which design inevitably comes before ethical assessment since the design influences heavily how the technology will interact with society. In this paper, we review an approach we undertook to early ethical assessment of nanobiosensors adapted for traceability systems to enhance food safety and animal and plant health monitoring. The approach is based on "expert committee" methods for integrating information from a range of disciplinary perspectives. It attempts to address the dilemma of early assessment through an integrative workshop discussion of how nanobiosensors should be represented during public engagement. Following the workshop, we conducted a metanalysis of the discussion transcript. The metanalysis shows that while the workshop approach responds to preliminary needs for the development of ethical assessment tools and processes, it also highlights inescapable challenges of ethical analysis. We identify key challenges and discuss their theoretical implications and implications for participatory assessment. We consider workshop discussion itself, and we consider the workshop as modeling one part of a cumulative process of assessment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The tree constitutes an ecosystem in which microorganisms play an essential role in its functionality. Interactions that microorganisms establish with plants may be beneficial or detrimental and are of extreme importance in the exploitation of trees in agriculture as crop production systems. Fruit trees, especially pomefruit trees including apple, pear and several ornamentals are of great economic importance but its production is affected by several diseases. Fungal and bacterial fruit tree diseases are mainly controlled with chemical fungicides and bactericides, but health and environmental concerns about the use of chemical pesticides have result in strong regulatory actions and have stimulated the development of beneficial microorganisms as microbial pesticides. Up to now, several microorganisms have been registered in different countries and in the EU as biocontrol agents (BCA) covering mainly fire blight, soil-borne fungal diseases and postharvest fruit fungal rot. The key aspects in the success of this technology for disease control are related to biosafety and environmental impact of biocontrol agents, the traceability and fate in the environment and food chain, the improvement by physiological, genetic engineering or the use of mixtures or formulations as well as the industrial production and development of delivery systems for treatment application to trees.

AB The aim of this study is to combine advanced GC-MS and metabolite identification in a robust and repeatable technology platform to characterize the metabolome of buffalo milk and mozzarella cheese. The study utilized eleven dairies located in a protected designation of origin (PDO) region and nine dairies located in non-PDO region in Italy. Samples of raw milk (100 mL) and mozzarella cheese (100 g) were obtained from each dairy. A total of 185 metabolites were consistently detected in both milk and mozzarella cheese. The PLS-DA score plots clearly differentiated PDO and non-PDO milk and mozzarella samples. For milk samples, it was possible to divide metabolites into two classes according to region: those with lower concentrations in PDO samples (galactopyranoside, hydroxybuthyric acid, allose, citric acid) and those with lower concentrations in non-PDO samples (talopyranose, pantothenic acid, mannobiose, etc.,). The same was observed for mozzarella samples with the proportion of some metabolites (talopyranose, 2, 3-dihydroxypropyl icosanoate, etc.,) higher in PDO samples while others (tagatose, lactic acid dimer, ribitol, etc.,) higher in non-PDO samples. The findings establish the utility of GC-MS together with mass spectral libraries as a powerful technology platform to determine the authenticity, and create market protection, for "Mozzarella di Bufala Campana."

AB Pesticide application monitoring and long-term data recording in the field is typically the first step in fruit traceability. In a spray monitoring and guiding system, identification of the sprayer movement is a key part of technology. Although Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is a widely used system to obtain location information, in an orchard/vineyard, especially one in which the trees/plants have tall and large canopies, the continuity and stability of the GNSS signal may decrease dramatically and lead to failure of guidance. A Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFID) solution for identifying sprayer travel was proposed, and a spray monitoring and guiding system was designed based on this solution. In-lab system simulation test and field test results showed that the system could distinguish the travel direction of the sprayer, identify its location in the field, record flow rate information, calculate sprayed volume, and show all the above information on a computer screen in real-time when the RFID reader had successfully registered each RFID card. For the monitoring and guiding system with one antenna on each side, which required the cards and the antennas to be at the same height, the best relative position was found by placing the card parallel to the antenna. The results of tests in the field showed that an improved system with two antennas on each side, which only required the cards to be put in the band with a width of 0.26 m between the centers of the two antennas, worked better with the best antenna angle of 125 degrees when the speed of the sprayer was less than 1.8 m/s.

AB IR Biotyper (IRBT), which is a spectroscopic system for microorganism typing based on Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) technology, has been used to detect the spread of clones in clinical microbiology laboratories. However, the use of IRBT to detect probiotics has rarely been reported. Herein, we evaluated the discriminatory power of IRBT to type Lactiplantibacillus plantarum isolates at the strain level and explored its application potential in probiotic preliminary selection. Twenty Lactiplantibacillus isolates collected from pickled radishes during successive fermentation were used to test the robustness of IRBT at the strain level. IRBT was then compared with genotyping methods such as whole-genome sequencing (WGS), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) to evaluate its discrimination power. IRBT distributed the 20 isolates into five clusters, with L. argentoratensis isolate C7-83 being the most distant from the other isolates, which belonged to L. plantarum. IRBT showed good reproducibility, although deviation in the discriminative power of IRBT was found at the strain level across laboratories, probably due to technical variance. All examined methods allowed bacterial identification at the strain level, but IRBT had higher discriminatory power than MLST and was comparable to the WGS and PFGE. In the phenotypic comparison study, we observed that the clustering results of probiotic physiological attributes (e.g., sensitivity to acid and bile salts, hydrophobicity of the cell surface, and resistance to antibiotics) were consistent with the typing results of IRBT. Our results indicated that IRBT is a robust tool for L. plantarum strain typing that could improve the efficiency of probiotic identification and preliminary screening, and can potentially be applied in probiotic traceability and quality control.

AB Identifying the geographical origins of green teas produced in specific regions is of significance since the geographical origin of tea influences its quality and price greatly. In this work, a novel two-dimensional (2D) fingerprints acquired by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) was firstly proposed to identify geographical origins of Chinese green teas. A total number of 62 chemical components were extracted from 2D HPLC-DAD fingerprints of 78 tea samples by multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) algorithm. Afterward, principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were used to classify tea samples based on the extracted components. Inspection of PCA score plots of two scaling types (UV and Par) showed that tea samples from two different geographical origins have an obvious clustering tendency. As for the OPLS-DA analysis, the Q2cum of two typesscaling OPLS-DA models are greater than 0.75, and the total recognition rates for test set are 92.86%. What's more, according to p value of t-test, VIP values, V-plot and S-plot, 17 characteristic components were screened and identified as chemical markers to distinguish between Zhejiang teas and Shandong teas. This work indicated that the proposed strategy is suitable for identifying geographical origins of Chinese green teas.

DE Growth; Calves; Animal traceability; Deep learning; Animal

AB Advances in machine learning techniques have allowed the development of computer vision systems (CVS) that can accurately predict several phenotypes of interest for livestock operations. In this context, 3D images taken from a top-down view are particularly useful for estimating body condition score, growth development, and body biometrics in cattle. Frequently, such CVS rely on identification (ID) systems, such as electronic tags, as a way to match animal ID and the predicted phenotype. However, the same 3D images used to predict body weight and other animal biometrics could be adopted for animal recognition as well. Such alternative would optimize CVS to recognize animal ID and monitor growth development simultaneously while leveraging the same hardware infrastructure. Furthermore, this strategy could be used to recognize animals with similar color patterns. Nonetheless, growing animals are continuously changing body shape, which could limit its use as an invariant feature for pattern recognition. Thus, the objectives of this study were: (1) to compare algorithms for different 3D object representations to identify individual animals; and (2) to evaluate how short-term changes in body shape due to animal growth affect the predictive performance of these algorithms. For objective 1, the algorithms were trained (n = 4,558) and tested (n = 1,139) using images from 38 Holstein calves. For objective 2, we designed three different experiments using images (n = 2,347) from five Holstein calves taken over six weeks during their growing period, always training and testing on different weeks. Each experiment evaluated how changing a different parameter of the image capturing procedure affected the predictive ability of the trained algorithms. In the first experiment, we varied the total number of images per animal in the training set; in the second experiment, we varied the number of weeks while keeping a fixed number of images in the training set; and in the third experiment, we skipped weeks between images in the training and test sets. The F-1 score for objective (1) was up to 0.804 when testing with the last frames of each video, and up to 0.959 when using random frames for testing. For objective (2), the F-1 score was up to 0.947 for the first experiment when using 130 images per animal; up to 0.979 for the second experiment when using all five weeks; and up to 0.917 when not skipping weeks between training and testing. These results show that deep learning algorithms can be used to identify individual animals through their dorsal area 3D surfaces, and, from our experiments using calves in their growing period, that they are robust enough to account for changes in body shape and size, making them a promising tool for animal recognition during growth.

AB A new frontier of nondestructive measurement exploitation is explored in this paper as concerns the food traceability and control arena. Presented is a method for nondestructive automated peach tree rootstock classification by means of high spectral resolution spectroscopy and multivariate signal processing. Many studies have shown that rootstock has significant impact on the quality and maturity of peach fruits. Rootstock knowledge not only enables fruit traceability but also helps in selecting the best storage condition and marketing channel. A novel automated method is presented to classify peach fruits with respect to their rootstock based on multivariate signal processing of fruit skin reflectance spectra, which are highly affected by physical and biochemical phenomena associated with fruit quality and maturity. The experimental results exploiting measurements of fruit skin reflectance spectra acquired in the visible and near infrared ranges with a high-resolution spectrometer show that automated rootstock classification by spectroscopic measurements and signal processing techniques is feasible and effective and has great potential in horticultural engineering.

AB Purpose Methods to assess the authenticity and traceability of wines have been extensively studied as enhancers of food quality, allowing producers to obtain market recognition and premium prices. Among analytical techniques, the volatilome profile attained by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry is acquiring more and more attention by the scientific community, together with the use of chemometrics Design/methodology/approach The volatilome profile of three varieties of blanc wines from the Collio area (namely Ribolla Gialla, Malvasia and Friulano) between Italy and Slovenia, was determined by head space-solid phase micro extraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, enhancing the carbonyl compounds identification with O-(2, 3, 4, 5, 6-pentafluorobenzyl)-hydroxylamine with the aim of identifying the autochthonous Friulano variety. Findings A two-step chemometric approach based on an unsupervised technique (PCA) followed by a supervised one (PLS-DA) allowed to identify possible markers for discriminating the Friulano Collio variety from the others, in particular two chemical classes were identified by PCA (ketones and long chain esters). PLS-DA showed 87% accuracy in classification. A correct classification (i.e. non-Friulano Collio) of a group of wines obtained from the same grape variety but produced in an extra-Collio area was obtained as well. The results confirmed the benefits of using a derivatization step prior to volatile organic compounds analysis. Research limitations/implications Among methods to assess the authenticity and traceability of wines, volatilome profile of wines determined by head space-solid phase micro extraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, enhanced by the carbonyl compound identifications with O-(2, 3, 4, 5, 6-pentafluorobenzyl)-hydroxylamine, may have a key role in conjunction with chemometrics and, in particular with principal component analysis and partial least square discriminant analysis. Practical implications Among methods to assess the authenticity and traceability of Friulano wine, volatilome profile of wines determined by head space-solid phase micro extraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, enhanced by the carbonyl compound identifications with O-(2, 3, 4, 5, 6-Pentafluorobenzyl)Hydroxylamine hydrochloride, may have a key role in conjunction with chemometrics. Originality/value Few works investigated both wine traceability with a volatilome enhancer and chemometrics of the Friulano wine variety obtaining such an improvement in this wine variety discrimination.

AB Verification of the authenticity of natural and agricultural foods has become a potential application of spectroscopic methods such as ultraviolet (UV), visible (VIS), near infrared (NIR), and mid-infrared (MIR). Adulteration can take many forms, including the addition of sugars, acids, volatile oils, overdilution of concentrate, addition of juices of other fruits, use of concentrate in a fresh product, and use of low-quality product recovered from what are normally waste products of manufacture. Food adulteration has been practiced since ancient times but has become more sophisticated in the recent past. Foods or ingredients most likely to be targets for adulteration include those that are of high value or subject to the vagaries of weather during their growth or harvest. The practice of adulteration commonly arises for two main reasons: firstly, it can be profitable, and secondly, adulterants can be easily mixed and are subsequently difficult to detect. To counter this problem, manufacturers subject their raw material and by-products to a series of quality controls, including high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), thin-layer chromatography (TLC), enzymatic tests, and physical tests. This mini-review highlights recent applications on the use of NIR and MIR spectroscopy to trace and authenticate natural and agricultural products.

AB The taste of fresh mushrooms is always appealing. Phlebopus portentosus is the only porcini that can be cultivated artificially in the world, with a daily output of up to 2 tons and a large sales market. Fresh mushrooms are very susceptible to microbial attacks when stored at 0-2 degrees C for more than 5 days. Therefore, the freshness of P. portentosus must be evaluated during its refrigeration to ensure food safety. According to their freshness, the samples were divided into three categories, namely, category I (1-2 days, 0-48 h, recommended for consumption), category II (3-4 days, 48-96 h, recommended for consumption), and category III (5-6 days, 96-144 h, not recommended). In our study, a fast and reliable shelf life identification method was established through Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy combined with a machine learning method. Deep learning (DL) is a new focus in the field of food research, so we established a deep learning classification model, traditional supportvector machine (SVM), partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and an extreme learning machine (ELM) model to identify the shelf life of P. portentosus. The results showed that FT-NIR two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS) combined with the deep learning model was more suitable for the identification of fresh mushroom shelf life and the model had the best robustness. In conclusion, FT-NIR combined with machine learning had the advantages of being nondestructive, fast, and highly accurate in identifying the shelf life of P. portentosus. This method may become a promising rapid analysis tool, which can quickly identify the shelf life of fresh edible mushrooms.

DT Article
DE attribute-based encryption; traitor tracing; framework
AB Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a versatile one-to-many encryption primitive, which enables fine-grained access control over encrypted data. Due to its promising applications in practice, ABE schemes with high efficiency, security and expressivity have been continuously emerging. On the other hand, due to the nature of ABE, a malicious user may abuse its decryption privilege. Therefore, being able to identify such a malicious user is crucial towards the practicality of ABE. Although some specific ABE schemes in the literature enjoys the tracing function, they are only proceeded case by case. Most of the ABE schemes do not support traceability. It is thus meaningful and important to have a generic way of equipping any ABE scheme with traceability. In this work, we partially solve the aforementioned problem. Namely, we propose a way of transforming (non-traceable) ABE schemes satisfying certain requirements to fully collusion-resistant black-box traceable ABE schemes, which adds only elements to the ciphertext where is the number of users in the system. And to demonstrate the practicability of our transformation, we show how to convert a couple of existing non-traceable ABE schemes to support traceability.

AB The rational utilization of aerial parts (stem and leaf) of Paris polyphylla var. yunnanensis (P. yunnanensis) is increasingly being studied, due to the growing scarcity of resources. In our study, the geographical origin and cultivation year classification of 662 cultivated P. yunnanensis rhizome, stem and leaf samples from Yuxi, Lijiang and Honghe cities were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared-attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) spectra using principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), random forest (RF) methods combined with multi-source information fusion strategies. Firstly, samples collected from Honghe procedure among all geographical origins were showed higher consistency by biomass analysis. Besides, the PLS-DA model of leaves part was obtained the better geographical origin classification ability than that of underground part (rhizomes), which demonstrate that leaves can be applied to identify geographical origins of P. yunnanensis effectively. And the geographical origins have a greater influence on the P. yunnanensis samples than the cultivation years. Thirdly, the PLS-DA model based on aerial parts combined with high-level multi-source information fusion strategy and important variables selection method can reach the best classification effect (100%) as same as the models of individual dataset of rhizomes. Our study provides a reference for the rational utilization of aerial parts (stems and leaves) for P. yunnanensis such as in the field of fast and effectively classification researches.

AB In this review we propose the use of telomeric length (TL) as an authenticity marker that could provide an alternative method for differentiating fish and seafood samples or detecting fraud. Considering the ever-growing number of incidents of economically motivated fish and seafood adulteration using even more sophisticated methods to overcome current authenticity markers, the need to identify novel authenticity markers becomes essential. The TL of fish and seafood depends on individual characteristics (e.g., sex, age) and the environmental stimuli (e.g., temperature, water quality) to which these are exposed. Hence, both wild marine and freshwater populations occupying different geographical origin habitats might differ substantially because of the environmental cues affecting them. Moreover, the implementation of various rearing practices in aquaculture, such as different levels of fish and seafood density and increased ambient noise combined with site-specific environmental cues could affect TL, providing regulatory authorities with valuable information by distinguishing wild from reared populations and organic from conventional ones. In the present review the effects of both the environmental conditions and individual characteristics on the telomeric stability of fish and seafood telomeres are discussed, suggesting TL as a potential prospect authenticity marker that could be used to prevent fish and seafood adulteration.

AB The DNA barcoding approach was used for the species identification of 44 Indonesian commercial fishery products. Additionally, the intronless nuclear rhodopsin gene fragment (RH1) was added to the analysis to enable the identification of species not yet barcoded and possible hybrids. The 655-bp cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COI) gene fragment marker was successfully amplified and used to identify 86% of the total fish samples at the species level using the BOLD and BLAST public databases. Moreover, the RH1 marker was used to complete COI analysis. For a number of fish species, the COI sequences (six species) and RH1 sequences (eight species) were the first entries submitted to GenBank. This study demonstrated that COI barcoding is a promising tool for Indonesian fishery products and confirmed that it could be adopted in the future for regular seafood control as part of the Indonesian integrated food traceability system.

AB Table grapes are very popular for their high nutritional and therapeutic value. The objective of this work was to study the effect of table grapes' quality property in cold chain logistics for improving the transparency and traceability of table grapes' cold chain logistics and ensuring the table grapes' quality and safety. Temperature and relative humidity are monitored by adopting the wireless sensor network (WSN) as the fundamental network infrastructure and adaptive optimal weighted data fusion (AOW) for the adaptive data fusion. The cold chain process, firmness quality and adaptive data fusion of temperature and relative humidity were evaluated in an actual cold chain logistics. The results indicate that the WSN and AOW methods could effectively reflect the real-time temperature and relative humidity information and quality property, improve the transparency and traceability in the cold chain and ensure the preservation of the quality and safety of table grapes. The AOW performance analysis shows that the AOW, whose mean absolute error and mean relative error of the temperature data are 0.06 degrees C and 8.61% and relative humidity data are 0.12% and 0.23%, respectively, could fuse the sensor data accurately, efficiently and adaptively and meet the actual application requirements.

AB The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) by US consumers has grown in recent years. CAM therapies often utilize medicinal herbs as part of the treatment process; however, research on US practitioner preferences for medicinal herbs is limited, despite growing concern surrounding the sustainability of wild-harvested medicinal herbs. In order better to understand consumer preferences for this emerging market, a mail survey of US practitioners (licensed acupuncturists) was conducted to examine the importance of five herb attributes in practitioners' herb selection decisions: (1) country of origin, (2) freshness, (3) production method (organic versus conventional), (4) price, and (5) traceability. The significance of these five traits is investigated using discrete choice analysis, and the implications for US medicinal herb growers are discussed.

AB The Chinese government has always promoted the pork traceability system; however, expensive traceable pork of limited variety containing single-level safety information cannot meet the differentiated consumer demand of the Chinese market. A survey was conducted of 2,080 consumers in five cities distributed in east, south, southwest, northeast, and central China, in which traceable pork hindquarter profiles were constructed by combining traceable safety information attributes with government certification, appearance, and price. Individual consumers' part-worth utilities were estimated using a choice experiment and hierarchical Bayesian inference. On this basis, combined with ordinary pork hindquarter profiles in the real market, different traceable pork hindquarter profiles were set to develop seven market schemes. Furthermore, market shares of each scheme were simulated using the random first choice method. Most consumers chose appearance rather than safety in the choice experiment, which also indicated that traceable safety information certified by the government had a higher part-worth utility. Simulation results suggested that a larger market share could be better achieved by supplying multilevel traceable pork hindquarters in the market at the same time, rather than by supplying single-level traceable pork hindquarters. Moreover, income was found to be the key factor in determining consumers' demand.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB Growing interest in food quality and traceability by regulators as well as consumers demands advances in more rapid, versatile and cost-effective analytical methods. Milk, as most food matrices, is a heterogeneous mixture composed of metabolites, lipids and proteins. One of the major challenges is to have simultaneous, quantitative detection (profiling) of this panel of biomolecules to gather valuable information for assessing food quality, traceability and safety. Here, for milk analysis, atmospheric pressure matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization employing homogenous liquid sample droplets was used on a Q-TOF mass analyzer. This method has the capability to produce multiply charged proteinaceous ions as well as highly informative profiles of singly charged lipids/metabolites. In two examples, this method is coupled with user-friendly machine-learning software. First, rapid speciation of milk (cow, goat, sheep and camel) is demonstrated with 100% classification accuracy. Second, the detection of cow milk as adulterant in goat milk is shown at concentrations as low as 5% with 92.5% sensitivity and 94.5% specificity.

AB The European mandatory labeling system for fishery products excludes the indication of the catch or production origin for fish-based processed food. However, while producers can voluntarily indicate this information on labels, they incur extra production costs for following procedures for tracing and guaranteeing the origin of their ingredients. Our study investigates whether consumers can be attracted by a marketing strategy based on transparency and traceability. We applied a dichotomous choice contingent valuation method on a sample of 250 Italian consumers. Findings indicate that consumers are willing to pay an average premium price of 4.75% for knowing the catch zone of fish used as ingredients of fish-based processed food (seafood salad or marinated anchovies in this study). The premium price is positively influenced by education and gender. [EconLit citations: D12; M31]

ID DIVERSIFICATION; COREGULATION; PERFORMANCE; PREVENTION; COST
AB Using data collected from a pork firm survey, we develop a modeling framework and use the conjectural variation method to examine the effect of market power on the food safety of the pork industry in China. Probit models with a two-step Heckman selection procedure are applied to identify the determinants of the likelihood and degree of food safety violations. Market power is found to reduce the likelihood of violation but not the degree of violation. Other factors such as traceability systems, adoption of risk control systems and industry standards, and the scale and scope of operations also impact food safety violations. Findings suggest that market power in China's pork industry provides incentives for firms to mitigate risk and improve food safety. However, firms may continue to have challenges in meeting food safety obligations when moving toward mega-size and product diversification.

AB Background: The cultivated tomato is second most consumed vegetable of the world and is an important part of a diverse and balanced diet as a rich source of vitamins, minerals, phenolic antioxidants and antioxidant lycopene having anti-cancer properties. To reap benefit of genomics of the domestic tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) unravelled by Tomato Genome Consortium (The Tomato Genome Consortium, 2012), the bulk mining of its markers in totality is imperative and critically required. The solgenomics has limited number of microsatellite DNA markers (2867) pertaining to solanaceae family. As these markers are of linkage map having relative distance, the choice of selected markers based on absolute distance as of physical map is missing. Only limited microsatellite markers with limitations are reported for variety identification thus there is a need for more markers supplementing DUS test and also for traceability of product in global market.
   Description: We present here the first whole genome based microsatellite DNA marker database of tomato, TomSatDB (Tomato MicroSatellite Database) with more than 1.4 million markers mined in-silico, using MIcroSAtellite (MISA) tool. To cater the customized needs of wet lab, features with a novelty of an automated primer designing tool is added. TomSatDB (http://cabindb.iasri.res.in/tomsatdb), a user-friendly and freely accessible tool offers chromosome wise as well as location wise search of primers. It is an online relational database based on "three-tier architecture" that catalogues information of microsatellites in MySQL and user-friendly interface developed using PHP (Hypertext Pre Processor).
   Conclusion: Besides abiotic stress, tomato is known to have biotic stress due to its susceptibility over 200 diseases caused by pathogenic fungi, bacteria, viruses and nematodes. These markers are expected to pave the way of germplasm management over abiotic and biotic stress as well as improvement through molecular breeding, leading to increased tomato productivity in India as well as other parts of the world. In era of IPR the new variety can be identified based on allelic variation among varieties supplementing DUS test and product traceability.

AB BACKGROUND With increasing attention being paid to food authenticity, the geographic origin of food has become a topic of interest for both consumers and producers. As far as we know, there are relatively few studies on the origin traceability of concentrated apple juice. The most commonly used methods of origin tracing research is by using stable isotopes and mineral elements technology, because these indicators are directly related to local geographical environment.
   RESULTS In this study, a discriminant model was established by determining the content of the stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta O-18) and 13 mineral elements (B, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Sr, V, Ba, Fe, Mg, Na, Ca and Cr) in concentrated apple juice. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were employed for regional classification of samples. After data conversion and correlation analysis, spatial and quantitative prediction models were established using multiple linear regressions. Finally, the experimental results showed that the eight key variables(delta (13) C, delta (18) O, B, Ca, Mg, Cu, Sr and Na) selected by the analysis can be used to further characterize the production area.
   CONCLUSION The results showed that the carbon and oxygen isotopes combined with certain mineral elements can be used to indicate the origin of concentrated apple juice. (c) 2020 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Looking for a strategy to authenticate the declared origin of commercial extra virgin olive oils (EVOOs), 126 samples from six different Mediterranean geographical indications (GIs) are analyzed by means of two different platforms [LC-ESI-QTOF MS (in positive and negative polarity) and GC-APCI-QTOF MS (in positive mode)] combined to chemometrics. The sample treatment and chromatographic/detection conditions (in both platforms) are chosen to enable the comprehensive characterization of the complete minor fraction of the oils within a single run. Noticeable discrimination among the six evaluated GIs [Priego de Cordoba and Baena (Spain), Kalamata (Greece), Toscano (Italy), and Ouazzane and Meknes (Morocco)] is achieved building two-class PLS-DA models which consider the data coming from both platforms. The contribution of a few thousand molecular features to the statistical models is evaluated in depth and several compounds are pointed out as possible origin markers, describing characteristic compositional patterns for each GI in the evaluated crop year. The complementarity of the different analytical approaches is discussed and diverse strategies are used to identify the classifiers. Practical Applications: Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) and Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) labels are important tools to promote high quality EVOOs, assuring the connection to a particular territory and the characteristic combination of natural and human factors which make possible to obtain unique oils. In this context, it is imperative to furnish the control labs with innovative tools and methods which are able to provide extensive information about the EVOOs' minor fraction (of unquestionable importance regarding its overall quality) in just one run and to give the chance to find and identify (and validate) origin markers. The utility of validated classifiers to authenticate the belonging (or not) of an EVOO to a particular GI is clear. The consumers' confidence can be perceptibly undermined if the geographical name is used on products not having the expected qualities or if the production specifications are sometimes not followed by producers.

AB Geographical traceability is critical to the commercial viability of the highly valued Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis). This study examined the possibility of utilizing a combination of multi-element and stable isotope analysis, together with multivariate statistical authenticity analysis, to identify the origins of 164 commodity crabs (using the third pereiopod as the sample material) from eight sites around China. The delta C-13, delta N-15 values and the Na, Mg, Al, K, Ca, Mn, Cu, Zn, Sr, Ba contents differed significantly depending on the crabs' origin. The linear discriminant analysis showed that 99.4% of the samples were correctly classified and the cross-validated accuracy rate was 98.2%. Meanwhile, the support vector machine exhibited high discrimination ability with 99.4% accuracy. This study provides a non-conventional, integrated approach for determining the traceability of E. sinensis. This method offers the potential of being able to identify an even more diverse geographical range of E. sinensis origins.

AB During a foodborne crisis, risk assessors are often scrambling to assemble data needed to trace suspected foods along very complex supply chains. Although traceability systems ensure that stakeholders in the supply chain record lot-specific trace-back and trace-forward data, there are few databases available that describe in detail the flow of product in the complex web of supply chains. This paper presents the methodological approach used to design and assemble a relational database of nation-wide trade data for packaged ready-to-eat lettuce and leafy greens. The database was used in the development of an integrated simulation tool (Canadian GIS-based Risk Assessment, Simulation and Planning for food safety tool, i.e. CanGRASP) that can predict the spatial distribution and public health risk associated with contaminated food. The database includes the geographical coordinates of 5 domestic processors, 28 produce distribution centres and 2946 retail outlets from five of the top ten retail chains in Canada. It also includes other critical information to predict the fate of pathogens during distribution of contaminated product through the supply chain including: (a) product volumes handled by each stakeholder, (b) flow of product between stakeholders, (c) temperatures of product each season, and (d) times products spend in each step or during transit between steps, for each season. The database is used by both the simulation and mapping components of the integrated simulation tool during risk assessment exercises associated with emergency preparedness planning and training. Using the database, CanGRASP was able to assess the spread of the population at risk during a simulation of a hypothetical outbreak caused by fresh-cut leafy vegetables contaminated with Escherichia coli O157:H7 in the Canadian food distribution systems during both summer and winter seasons.

AB Molecular methods, such as PCR and real-time PCR, have been developed to detect species in meat and meat products. Despite good specificity and sensitivity, they are not widely implemented in food control programs due to complex operation or financial reasons. In the present study, a simple, rapid and affordable method, Sheep-PCR-Strip [Sheep specific polymerase chain reaction-Strip], was developed for the authentic identification of raw and heat-treated mutton. The assay is based on PCR amplification of sheep DNA, followed by detection of the PCR product by a strip format; the result can be read within 5 min by the naked eye. There is a real advantage of the strip approach rather in the reduced time (5 min versus electrophoresis) and avoidance of chemicals (e.g. ethidiumbromide). The sensitivity of the Sheep-PCR-Strip test was established to be 0.01% for the detection of adulterated meat; the limit of detection (LOD) was up to 0.01 pg of sheep DNA. The assay was also specific for sheep, and no cross-reactions were observed in other non-target species. It is a promising new tool for sheep identification and can be rapidly modified for other meat detection and widely used for solving problems related to food quality assurance, species authentication and traceability.

AB To meet the labeling and traceability requirement of genetically modified (GM) maize and their products for trade and regulation, it is essential to develop a specific detection method for monitoring the presence of GM content. In this work, six GM maize lines, including GA21, Bt11, NK603, Bt176, Mir604, and Mon810, were simultaneously detected by universal primer-multiplex-polymerase chain reaction (UP-M-PCR), and the amplicons for the six event-specific genes as well as the endogenous Ivr gene were successfully separated by the method of capillary electrophoresis-laser-induced fluorescence (CE-LIF). The UP-M-PCR method overcame the disadvantages in conventional M-PCR, such as complex manipulation, lower sensitivity, amplification disparity resulting from different primers, etc., and in combination with CE-LIF, it obtained a high sensitivity of 0.1 ng for both single and mixed DNA samples. The established method can be widely used for the qualitative identification of the GM maize lines.

AB A new practical method able to identify wheat local landraces was implemented. It is based on computerized image analysis techniques and statistical identification, for the first time on the basis of glumes size, shape, colour and texture.
   Ears of 52 different Sicilian wheat landraces were reaped for three consecutive years. Digital images of the glumes were acquired, processed and analysed, measuring 138 quantitative morpho-colorimetic variables. The data were statistically analysed applying a Linear Discriminant Analysis. All the statistical comparisons, distinguished for systematic rank, given perfect identification performances; while an overall percentage of correct identification of 89.7% was reached when all the landraces were compared all together.
   Finally, the identification system was tested with an unknown glume sample, later entirely identified as Vallelunga, one of the Sicilian landraces.
   This work represents the first attempt of wheat landraces identification based on glume phenotypic characters, applying image analysis techniques. Considering the growing interest in local old wheat Iandraces, strongly linked to the renewed appreciation in traditional and typical local products, the obtained results support the application of the image analysis system not only for grading purposes, but also to define the product traceability, in order to get a "market card" for wheat landraces.

AB Despite the growing importance of the digital transformation (DT) of the agrifood sector on the political agenda, traditional policies are not enough to provide proactive responses to rapid technological changes and new approaches for policy planning are necessary especially at regional level. This manuscript proposes and illustrates the implementation of a new methodological framework for DT policy planning in the case of Andalusia, the olive world leader region, but applicable to other regions and sectors, with two objectives: 1) to quantitatively determine the importance of the conditioning factors of DT in the olive sector in the short/medium term, by developing an AHP/SWOT/PESTLE model, and 2) to design public policies to strengthen the DT, taking advantage of the potentialities and alleviating the deficiencies, by carrying out a quantitative TOWS analysis. The knowledge of diverse groups of experts, i.e. stakeholders in the sector, has been used in all analyses due to the lack of reliable data and the complex nature of the issues analysed. The results show that the opportunities and strengths are more prominent than weaknesses and threats for DT. Environmental issues stand out as an opportunity to boost DT. There is also a growing interest in developing an interoperability strategy which is an opportunity to overcome the low technological integration of the value chain. DT can also enable a more transparent value chain and improved traceability. Some negative factors are the lack of evidence on the economic viability of investment in digital technologies, shortage of labour and young farmers, and potential unintended and unanticipated effects of DT. Important policies strategies to foster DT are: improving environmental efficiency though DT; promoting youth employment in the sector; enhancing coordination among innovation actors; developing a common interoperability strategy; and fostering technological integration in the sector.

AB BACKGROUNDChicory stems, appreciated both raw and cooked, represent a nutritious and refined food. In this study the effects on the quality of stems cooked by conventional (boiling, steaming and microwaving) and innovative (sous vide) methods were analysed. Several physical, chemical and sensory traits were compared using two local varieties (Galatina and Molfettese) of southern Italy (Puglia region).
   RESULTSIndependently of the variety, the sous vide method did not significantly affect (redness, yellowness and hue angle) or had the least impact on (lightness and total colour difference) quality parameters among the four methods as compared with the raw product. Following sensory analysis, the sous vide product always showed the highest score among the cooking methods. Moreover, this innovative method did not affect total phenol (TP) content and antioxidant activity (AA) compared with uncooked stems of both varieties. Microwaving increased TP content and AA (though associated with higher weight loss), while different responses depending on the chicory variety were observed after boiling and steaming.
   CONCLUSIONThe results indicate the sous vide technique as optimal to preserve several traits, including organoleptic ones, for the quality of cook-chilled chicory stems. They also provide product-specific information usually required for cooking process strategies in the industrial sector of ready-to-eat vegetables. (c) 2013 Society of Chemical Industry

AB A major challenge in analyzing the data from high-throughput next-generation sequencing < NGS > is how to handle the huge amounts of data and variety of NGS tools and visualize the resultant outputs. To address these issues, we developed a cloud-based data analysis platform, Maser < Management and Analysis System for Enormous Reads >, and an original genome browser, Genome Explorer < GE >. Maser enables users to manage up to 2 terabytes of data to conduct analyses with easy graphical user interface operations and offers analysis pipelines in which several individual tools are combined as a single pipeline for very common and standard analyses. GE automatically visualizes genome assembly and mapping results output from Maser pipelines, without requiring additional data upload. With this function, the Maser pipelines can graphically display the results output from all the embedded tools and mapping results in a web browser. Therefore Maser realized a more user-friendly analysis platform especially for beginners by improving graphical display and providing the selected standard pipelines that work with built-in genome browser. In addition, all the analyses executed on Maser are recorded in the analysis history, helping users to trace and repeat the analyses. The entire process of analysis and its histories can be shared with collaborators or opened to the public. In conclusion, our system is useful for managing, analyzing, and visualizing NGS data and achieves traceability, reproducibility, and transparency of NGS analysis.

AB Channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, is one of the most important fish on Mexican aquaculture and despite its productive potential, there is very few information regarding the distribution of Ictalurus species in Mexican territory. Sequencing of Cytochrome Oxidase I gene has proved to be very useful for the identification of fish specimens and sub-products. In the present, we report the molecular identification of 93 feral, commercial and domestic catfish individuals. All domestic fish were positively identified as channel catfish. Commercial samples were identified as Ictalurus punctatus, Ictalurus lupus, and Ictalurus furcatus, providing evidence that catfish represents a generic label for separate fish species. We also report the presence of feral I. punctatus on eight novel locations within Mexican territory, I. lupus on three and I. furcatus in one. Thus, we propose that molecular identification by DNA barcoding represents a powerful tool in the study of catfish populations and sub-products.

AB The number of fishery products with a quite detailed description of the origin is increasing. This trend is driven by the interest of consumers and the fight against illegal unregulated and unreported fisheries. Unfortunately, there is a lack of methods to prove this information experimentally besides the document-based traceability assessments. For marine fish population genetics is a promising strategy, but research is concentrated only on a few species. Saithe is a commercially important fish species, despite the fact that genetic knowledge is scarce regarding the specification of populations. For a comparative study cost- and time-effective strategies were tested: We found RAPD-PCR to be a useful method for low-budget research or prestudies. Adoption of microsatellites from closely related species turned out to be possible with limited success quota. Our results suggest a clustered structure of populations within the Northeast Atlantic, probably overlapping in the northern North Sea.

AB In the present study, a methodology based on the amplification of a fragment of mitochondrial cytochrome b and subsequent phylogenetic analysis (FINS: forensically informative nucleotide sequencing) to genetically identify horse mackerels have been developed. This methodology makes possible the identification of more than 20 species belonging to the families Carangidae, Mullidae, and Scombridae. The main novelty of this work lies in the longest number of different horse mackerel species included and in the applicability of the developed methods to all kinds of processed products that can be found by consumers in markets around the world, including those that have undergone intensive processes of transformation, as for instance canned foods. Finally., the methods were applied to 15 commercial samples, all of them canned products. Therefore, these methods are useful for checking the fulfillment of labeling regulations for horse mackerels and horse mackerel products, verifying the correct traceability in commercial trade, and fisheries control.

AB Biofuel quality control plays an important role considering the recent European policy about renewable energy source promotion. Origin and source of the raw material are often required to be stated by biofuel chain operators for traceability and sustainability issues. Being fast, non-destructive, and low-cost, infrared spectroscopy coupled with chemometrics is already applied to several sectors and could also be employed in the solid biomass sector. The result of this work is a tool for the prediction of hardwood and softwood contents in blend samples by means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy coupled with partial least squares regression. A total of 61 samples of fir, pine, sessile oak, and beech and four series of binary blends (28 samples) from wood powders of one hardwood species and one softwood species were analyzed. The infrared prediction model was full cross-validated. The results of this work showed the good performance of the model with a standard error of a few percentage points (3.8%). As a consequence, the development of an analytical instrument based on such techniques could be useful to support the bioenergy chain stakeholders, such as solid biofuel producers, traders, and customers, for traceability, process tuning, and quality control issues.

TI Detection of early bruises on apples using hyperspectral imaging
   combining with YOLOv3 deep learning algorithm
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD PROCESS ENGINEERING

DT Article
ID DEFECTS; SYSTEM; CALYX
AB The bruise on apples is a common damage mainly caused during the picking and transportation stages, but its detection robustness has not been satisfactory using the traditional machine learning method, and the precision of bruise detection with short formation time and light degree of bruise is low, and it is easily affected by the variable and complex environment, especially the bright spots. In this paper, a long-wave near infrared (LW-NIR 930-2,548 nm) hyperspectral imaging system for acquiring reflectance images of bruised apples were developed in this study. Then the regions of interest (ROIs) of sound and bruised tissues were analyzed and three specific spectral regions were determined. The segmented principal component analysis was performed to select characteristic wavelengths from the three regions. In order to verify the superiority over original hyperspectral data onto deep learning algorithms, the gray-scale images of characteristic wavelengths (dataset I) and their PC images (dataset II) were input into YOLOv3 network to develop a bruise detection model, respectively. The results showed that all 110 bruise spots of testing set were identified correctly with the YOLOv3 model of dataset I and achieved a F1-sore of 100% and FPS of 68, while the YOLOv3 model of dataset II and traditional detection method could not eliminate the interference of bright spots and misidentified them as bruises. In short, the YOLOv3 model based on the selected characteristic wavelengths has an excellent potential for on-line detection of apple bruises. Practical Applications Detection of apple bruises is essential to ensure the fruit quality of the same batch and the income of the farmers. In the past, most bruises were detected using traditional machine learning algorithms combined with hyperspectral imaging technology. This requires a series of cumbersome preprocessing and is susceptible to uneven brightness distribution of reflected image. Compared with the traditional method, our proposed detection model using hyperspectral imaging combining with YOLOv3 deep learning algorithm could obtain better detection accuracy and robustness, and avoid the problem of false detection caused by the interference of bright spots. Simultaneously, the method based on neural network provides a new idea for future multispectral online detection technology.

AB The quality and safety of agricultural products is not only related to the health of consumers, but also to the sustainable and stable development of the economy, and even to the harmony and stability of the society. The application of the theory model of multiple co-governance of agricultural product quality and safety has certain theoretical support. This paper applies big data technology to agricultural product quality and safety governance, and uses big data methods to study the key control points in the process of agricultural product traceability. Moreover, based on the selected key control points, this paper studies the key traceability indicators corresponding to the key control points of each link. In addition, this paper combines multi-disciplinary knowledge to carry out a systematic study on the legal issues of multivariate co-governance of agricultural product quality and safety in my country from the perspective of law. From the experimental research and the final decision-making suggestions, we can see that the method proposed in this paper is feasible.

AB The recent release of the Bovine HapMap dataset represents the most detailed survey of bovine genetic diversity to date, providing an important resource for the design and development of livestock production. We studied this dataset, comprising more than 30,000 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) for 19 breeds (13 taurine, three zebu, and three hybrid breeds), seeking to identify small panels of genetic markers that can be used to trace the breed of unknown cattle samples. Taking advantage of the power of Principal Components Analysis and algorithms that we have recently described for the selection of Ancestry Informative Markers from genomewide datasets, we present a decision-tree which can be used to accurately infer the origin of individual cattle. In doing so, we present a thorough examination of population genetic structure in modern bovine breeds. Performing extensive cross-validation experiments, we demonstrate that 250-500 carefully selected SNPs suffice in order to achieve close to 100% prediction accuracy of individual ancestry, when this particular set of 19 breeds is considered. Our methods, coupled with the dense genotypic data that is becoming increasingly available, have the potential to become a valuable tool and have considerable impact in worldwide livestock production. They can be used to inform the design of studies of the genetic basis of economically important traits in cattle, as well as breeding programs and efforts to conserve biodiversity. Furthermore, the SNPs that we have identified can provide a reliable solution for the traceability of breed-specific branded products.

AB At present, the geographical origin of extra virgin olive oils can be ensured by documented traceability, although chemical analysis may add information that is useful for possible confirmation. This preliminary study investigated the effectiveness of flash gas chromatography electronic nose and multivariate data analysis to perform rapid screening of commercial extra virgin olive oils characterized by a different geographical origin declared in the label. A comparison with solid phase micro extraction coupled to gas chromatography mass spectrometry was also performed. The new method is suitable to verify the geographic origin of extra virgin olive oils based on principal components analysis and discriminant analysis applied to the volatile profile of the headspace as a fingerprint. The selected variables were suitable in discriminating between "100% Italian" and "non-100% Italian" oils. Partial least squares discriminant analysis also allowed prediction of the degree of membership of unknown samples to the classes examined. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The demand for smart irrigation and water-saving practices in agriculture has triggered the development of different soil moisture sensing techniques that can operate under harsh field conditions. In this study, a soil moisture sensing technology appropriate for the field applications was comprehensively evaluated. From a qualitative and quantitative perspective, the Delphi and analytic hierarchy process methods were used to construct an index system involving technological advantage, economic benefit, risk analysis, policy support, four second-level indicators, and 23 fourth-level indicators. The results showed that economic benefits account for the largest weight. The practical evaluation resulted in 12 farms that showed that the selected soil water sensing methods performed reasonably and exhibited obvious water-saving irrigation benefits, which are usually used for scheduling irrigation. The overall score of M4 in different soil types was 0.2% lower than that of M5. Farms with reasonable economic conditions and a high awareness scored 5.3% higher on technology than those with modest economic conditions, which clearly affects the evaluation scores of the two technologies. The evaluation results help farmers and government decision-making bodies in technology selection, production decision-making, and risk control.

AB The lactation period is the first stage in a piglet's life cycle, and a piglet's activity during this time is an important indicator of the growth stage, better activity curve reflecting higher growth state. Detecting changes in physical activity may help in the early detection of unhealthy conditions and help a breeder carry out targeted treatment. However, both light interferences caused by devices such as heat preservation lamps and the difficulty of identifying piglets pose significant challenges for automated monitoring of piglet activity. In this study, we proposed an automated method for monitoring piglet activity. This method, named Frame Differences in combination with Convolution Neural Network (FD-CNN), was used to detect the regions of the active piglets by combining the frame difference method with the YOLOv5s network model. To estimate the whole average activity of piglets during lactation, the ratio of the area with active piglets to the area of all piglets was determined. The changing activity of day-old piglets was analyzed, and their status under different light source conditions was also evaluated. Video traceability was performed to detect the abnormal activity points, and the causes of these anomalies were studied. The results showed that our method could detect motion piglets (precision = 0.936) and quantify the activity status of piglets. When the detection frequencies were 6 s and 1 h, the similarity of activity value between the FD-CNN and manual detection were 58.36% and 78.90%, respectively. After the conversion of the activity metrics to values ranging from 0 to 1, the average activity value of day-old piglets with light was higher than 0.25 and that under the no-light condition was lower than 0.2. The traceability results of the abnormal activity points (activity value above 1) show that excess activity was mainly caused by sows attacking piglets or bumping into limits. The FD-CNN could replace the manual detection of piglet activity during lactation to a certain extent. The backtracking of abnormal activity points is beneficial for the timely detection of abnormal interaction behaviors between sows and piglets and provides technical support for the intelligent development of animal husbandry.

AB BACKGROUND: Commercial candies are consumed by all population age sectors worldwide. Methods for quality control and composition authentication are therefore needed for best compliance with consumers' preferences. In this study applications of DNA-based methodology for candy quality control have been tested. Eighteen samples of commercial candies (marshmallows, gumdrops, jelly, sherbet, gelatin-based desserts) produced by five countries were analyzed to identify the component species by polymerase chain reaction, cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA and ribulose -1,5-diphosphate carboxylase oxygenase genes, and the species determined from BLAST comparison with universal databases and phylogenetic analysis.
   RESULTS: Positive DNA extraction and amplification of the target genes were obtained for 94% of candies assayed, even those containing as little as < 0.0005 ng mu L-1 DNA concentration. The results demonstrated that the species detected from DNA were compatible with the information provided on candy labels only in a few products. DNA traces of undeclared species, including fish, were found in most samples, and two products were labeled as vegetarian but contained porcine DNA.
   CONCLUSION: Based on the inaccuracy found on the labels of sweets we recommend the use of DNA tests for quality control of these popular sweets. DNAtests have been useful in this field but next-generation sequencing methods could be more effective. (C) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry

AB A front-face fluorescence method has been used to obtain an excitation-emission matrix (EEM) of various Italian mono-cultivar, and mix-cultivar, extra virgin olive oils without any laborious sample preparation. These EEM use excitations from 230 to 360 nm and emissions from 260 to 390 nm to explore potential fingerprint characteristics that could be used for cultivar and geographical origin authentication. To simplify these complex spectral datasets, the variable reduction was undertaken using total absolute principal component coefficients. It has been found that at least 3 excitation wavelengths are necessary to obtain 5 variables which could explain more than 95% of the sample variance with 4 principal components. The 5 selected wavelength pairs (Ex./Em. 300/315; 300/340; 280/300; 280/320; and 265/330 nm) are recommended as a sensitive fingerprint of the EVOOs. Of the subsequent models explored based on this fingerprint, a non-parametric fine k-NN classifier was found to best classify the cultivar and geographical origins of the EVOOs. This result demonstrates that multiple excitation fluorescence techniques can be used for authentication of EVOO cultivars and geographical origins.

AB Panax notoginseng is an important functional health product, and has been used worldwide because of a wide range of pharmacological activities, of which the taproot is the main edible or medicinal part. However, the technologies for origin discrimination still need to be further studied. In this study, an ICP-MS/MS method for the accurate determination of 49 elements was established, whereby the instrumental detection limits (LODs) were between 0.0003 and 7.716 mg/kg, whereas the quantification limits (LOQs) were between 0.0011 and 25.7202 mg/kg, recovery of the method was in the range of 85.82% to 104.98%, and the relative standard deviations (RSDs) were lower than 10%. Based on the content of multi-element in P. notoginseng (total of 89 mixed samples), the discriminant models of origins and cultivation models were accurately determined by the neural networks (prediction accuracy was 0.9259 and area under ROC curve was 0.9750) and the support vector machine algorithm (both 1.0000), respectively. The discriminant models established in this study could be used to support transparency and traceability of supply chains of P. notoginseng and thus avoid the fraud of geographic identification.

AB This study provides an economics assessment of various food safety measures in China. A choice experiment approach is used to elicit Chinese consumer preferences for various food safety attributes using data from a 2008 urban consumer survey. An alternative welfare calculation is used to model aggregate market impacts of select food safety measures. Our results show that the largest welfare gains are found in the current government-run certification program. The implementation of a third-party certification system, a traceability network and a product label would generate significant value and would help reduce current system inefficiencies in China. This study builds on previous research and provides an alternative approach for calculating consumer valuation of safety and quality attributes that can be used to estimate aggregate economic and welfare impacts.

AB Narcotic plants contain substances that cause unusual excitation and subsequent depression of the central nervous system. Many narcotic plants contain substances that have medicinal properties and are used primarily as pain relievers. Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is one of the most cultivated narcotic plants. The planning of Opium poppy growing is controlled by United Nations and Drugs and Medicines Control Program. This study was conducted to establish a basis for determining the traceability of poppy cultivating areas using remote sensing in the large plain. A very high-resolution QuickBird-2 satellite image was used in the study. The software of ERDAS Imagine and eCognition Developer was performed for image processing and classification. A variety of classification methods were performed on the satellite image. ArcGIS software was used for accuracy assessment, ground control, and map production of the poppy cultivating area. The accuracy of classification methods was compared. The producer-user accuracy was estimated as 97.99% using spectral difference sub-segmentation process of multiresolution segmentation algorithm in object-based classifications method. This algorithm can be a practical approach for determining of opium poppy parcels in the large plain.

AB Background: The quality and value of chocolate are related to its unique and fascinating flavor arisen from volatile and non-volatile compounds present in the product. The particular chocolate aroma is dependent on various factors including genotype and the agro-ecological niche (environment conditions, farming practices), post-harvest conditions and complex biochemical and chemical reactions during this period (fermentation, drying) and manufacturing stages.
   Scope and approach: In this study, relationship between chemical compounds and cocoa flavors, control and management of post-harvest practices and manufacturing processing in order to obtain chocolate with differentiated characteristics and also evaluation methods especially sensory aspects of the chocolate are highlighted. For this purpose, instrumental experiments including headspace aroma extraction, simultaneous distillation extraction and sensory testing such as discrimination experiments, descriptive tests and hedonic experiments were discussed.
   Key findings and conclusions: A comprehensive link between the components of cocoa flavor, sensory characteristics, human acceptability, and also the processes involved in flavor formation and formulation used, will assist the administration of a traceability system, a challenging case for quality assurance groups.

AB BACKGROUND The use of PDO (protected designation of origin) and PGI (protected geographical indication) labels allows to protect and promote agricultural products characterized by unique features related to the place of origin and traditional know-how. However, the presence of non-authentic products in the market represents a fraud that can be tackled applying analytical techniques combined with chemometric analysis. In this study, we applied multi-element and multi-isotope analysis to characterize PDO and PGI apples cultivated in northern Italy, comparing them with Italian apples without labels of geographical indications.
   RESULTS The multi-element and multi-isotope approach allowed to characterize the apples cultivated in northern Italy. Despite a significant effect of the sampling sites on the apple composition, the comparison of the multi-chemical fingerprint of the apples significantly varied among cultivation areas. Results of this characterization were used to classify samples according to their cultivation area applying a linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Outputs of the LDA showed that correct sample classification can be successfully achieved (balanced accuracy > 96%). Moreover, using a selection of variables, it was possible to correctly classify samples also at regional level.
   CONCLUSION The presented evidences indicate that the multi-element and multi-isotope fingerprint can be successfully applied to traceability studies. The combination of this characterization with chemometric tools allows the classification of Italian apples based on their origin both on a national and regional scale. This approach represents an interesting tool to enhance and protect PDO and PGI Italian products.

AB Recent developments in consumption patterns, lowering of trade barriers, the emergence of low cost/miniature sensors and information technologies, and advanced business analytics tools are changing the playing field on which most of the agri-food supply chains operate. The intelligent use of sensing and information technologies has the potential to start a new food revolution in which limited resources such as water, capital, transportation capacity and labor could be optimally exploited so that fresh food, in particular fruits and vegetables, get to the consumer with minimal or no food waste. One of the keys for making this vision a reality is transforming the data collected as these products traverse the supply chain into effective and efficient supply chain decisions. This transformation relies on that the underlying decision systems that take advantage of this data exist or can be developed. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the state of the art and challenges and opportunities emerging from the integration of sensing data and information into decision support systems for supply chain of fresh fruits and vegetables.

AB Purpose While the essential role of brand trust toward consumer decision to purchase food products has been well addressed, there has been still little research on its influential factors. The primary purpose of this study was to explore factors affecting consumer trust in brands of safe vegetables. Design/methodology/approach Structural equation modeling technique was applied to test the hypothetical relationships based on a sample of 361 consumers from a face-to-face interview in the urban areas of Hanoi city, Vietnam, in March and April 2018. Findings The authors' findings show that both brand credibility and brand reputation positively affected brand trust. The trustworthiness of a safe vegetable system had a more important role than the competence in building brand trust. While the effects of system trustworthiness on brand trust were found directly and indirectly (through brand credibility), system competence only had an indirect influence on brand trust via brand reputation. Notably, while risk recall directly reduced brand trust, risk information caused a directly positive effect on brand trust. In addition, the impact of food hazards on brand trust was indirect through brand credibility. Practical implications Based on our results, the Vietnamese government and stakeholders in the safe vegetable chain should improve brand trust based on fulfilling comprehensive traceability, expanding the brand reputation and providing an appropriate risk communication strategy to the public. Originality/value This study is one of the first attempts to model and evaluate factors affecting brand trust in the food sector directly and indirectly.

AB Until now, the over-exploitation of wild resources has increased growing concern over the quality of wild medicinal plants. This led to the necessity of developing a rapid method for the evaluation of wild medicinal plants. In this study, the content of total secoiridoids (gentiopicroside, swertiamarin, and sweroside) of Gentiana rigescens from 37 different regions in southwest China were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Furthermore, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) was adopted to trace the geographical origin (331 individuals) and predict the content of total secoiridoids (273 individuals). In the traditional FT-IR analysis, only one scatter correction technique could be selected from a series of preprocessing candidates to decrease the impact of the light correcting effect. Nevertheless, different scatter correction techniques may carry complementary information so that using the single scatter correction technique is sub-optimal. Hence, the emerging ensemble approach to preprocessing fusion, sequential preprocessing through orthogonalization (SPORT), was carried out to fuse the complementary information linked to different preprocessing methods. The results suggested that, compared with the best results obtained on the scatter correction modeling, SPORT increased the accuracy of the test set by 12.8% in qualitative analysis and decreased the RMSEP by 66.7% in quantitative analysis.

AB The triacylglycerols composition of monovarietal Picholine Marocaine olive oils, produced in seven of the most productive areas in northern Morocco, has been established for the first time, starting a register of typicality and geographical identity of Moroccan olive oils. Two hundred seventy-nine olive samples were collected over two consecutive crop seasons (2011/2012 (n=140) and 2012/2013 (n=139)), the analysis of the triacylglycerol profiles of the obtained oils was performed using high performance liquid chromatography, the influence of the region of provenance was investigated, and chemometric data analysis (including principal components analysis, linear discriminant analysis, partial least squares-discriminant analysis, and soft independent modeling of class analogies) was used to differentiate the studied samples according to their geographical origin. Twenty-one triacylglycerols were characterized and the variability observed among the studied samples could be related to the production area. The combination of triacylglycerols composition with chemometrics provided a powerful tool to verify the geographical origin of north Moroccan olive oils. Practical applications: Moroccan legislations established Geographic Indication labels for adding value to typical products. However, the general procedure to control the geographical authenticity of these protected products remains based on the traceability of their production and there is a lack of appropriate and reliable tools for their geographical unambiguous authentication and control. In this work, geographical authentication models for classifying olive oil samples (based on triacylglycerols composition) have been developed and evaluated, achieving adequate classification and prediction rates for oils coming from the main north Moroccan olive growing areas. The results obtained herein, could represent a significant contribution to the control of the geographical authenticity of Moroccan olive oils.

AB Interest in the use of beech wood in construction is growing steadily. Considering its high mechanical performance, it has a large potential to be used for the production of glued timber structural products. However, the issue of structural bonding remains to be solved before effective production and safe use of beech wood in these products can be achieved. Three adhesives (one-component polyurethane - PUR, PUR + primer and melamine-urea-formaldehyde - MUF) and two press systems (hydraulic and vac-uum press) were explored in the production of pure beech and combined beech-spruce-beech cross laminated timber (CLT). An evaluation of the bonding quality was performed with both standardized and optimized (the specimen layers were oriented with the wood grain forming an angle of 45 degrees with respect to the load application) delamination and shear test methods.
   None of the adhesives that were tested met the requirements for delamination tests provided by the current standard for softwood. Specifically, PUR yielded the poorest performance in the production of the CLT panels entirely made of beech; the addition of a primer improved the bonding, achieving results comparable to those observed for MUF. On the contrary, in the production of beech-spruce panels, the three adhesives showed similar results. The press system was not a relevant factor in terms of bonding quality.
   In regard to testing, a size effect was noticed in the delamination test: the larger the specimen the greater the delaminations that were observed. The shear tests on dry specimens proved to be less efficient in determining the influence of the several bonding parameters, even if a 45 degrees grain orientation seemed to reduce the rolling shear during the shear test and to improve the response of the test in this regard. Combining delamination pretreatment and shear made the test more sensitive and objective. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Good Agricultural Practices are agricultural production methods which are applied for the goals of: to realise an agricultural production which doesn't harm to the healths of the human beings and animals; the protection of the natural resources; traceability and sustainability in agriculture and the food safety. In our country in recent years good agricultural practices are come out as a production method which is supported by the state at a lot of agricultural activities and is supported by the projects which are applied at different areas. As an example in Hatay, totally 29 producers,18 procuders (in an area of 1011 da) in 2014 and 11 producer (in an area of 540 da) in 2015, are certified by converting to good agricultural practices in the scope of "The Dissemination and Development Project of GAP in Citrus Growing". In this study, in the case of Hatay by applying a field research the technical and economical aspects of this 29 enterprises before and after the certification are determined and evaluated statistically. As a result of the research, it has been determined that the agricultural enterprises that make Good Agricultural Practices have increased their market share compared to the ones before the certification, and that they use the agricultural mechanization tools more consciously, especially the drilling efficiency and economical efficiency in agricultural spraying.

AB The objective of this research was to investigate the development of a reliable fingerprint from elemental and isotopic signatures of Argentinean honey to assess its geographical provenance. Honey, soil, and water from three regions (Cordoba, Buenos Aires, and Entre Rios) were collected. The multielemental composition was determined by ICP-MS. delta C-13 was measured by isotopic ratio mass spectrometry, whereas the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio was determined using thermal ionization mass spectrometry. The data were analyzed by chemometrics looking for the association between the elements, stable isotopes, and honey samples from the three studied areas. Honey samples were differentiated by classification trees and discriminant analysis using a combination of eight key variables (Rb, K/Rb, B, U, Sr-87/Sr-86, Na, La, and Zn) presenting differences among the studied regions. The application of canonical correlation analysis and generalized procrustes analysis showed 91.5% consensus between soil, water, and honey samples, in addition to clear differences between studied areas. To the authors knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the correspondence between soil, water, and honey samples using different statistical methods, showing that elemental and isotopic honey compositions are related to soil and water characteristics of the site of origin.

AB In order to realize on-line detection of defective apples on a two-lane fruit sorting machine, an inspection module was constructed using NIR cameras and a diffuse illumination chamber. A real-time apple defects inspection method was proposed based on YOLO V4 deep learning algorithm. The input images were generated by combining NIR images in three consecutive rubber roller stations. Channel pruning and layer pruning methods were used to simplify the YOLO V4 network and accelerate the detection speed. A non-maximum suppression (NMS) method based on Ll norm is proposed to remove redundant prediction box after fine-tuning the pruned network. The test results indicated that the model size and inference time of the pruning-based YOLO V4 network was decreased by 241.24 megabyte (MB) and 10.82 ms, respectively, and the mean average precision (mAP) was increased from 91.82% to 93.74%, compared with the YOLO V4 network before pruning. The pruning-based YOLO V4 network based on NIR images was not affected by the variation of skin color and suitable for detects identification of different cultivars including 'Fuji' apple covered in red-yellow striping and red blush, `Golden Delicious', and 'Granny Smith', with the average detection accuracy of 93.9% at the on-line test assessing five fruit per second. The overall results showed that the proposed pruning-based YOLO V4 network combined with the developed inspection module, had great potential to be implemented in commercial fruit packing line for fruit defects identification.

AB Background: Achieving the goal of sustainable development of the fruit and vegetables (F&Veg) value chain is heavily dependent on processing at both the global and local levels. The future contribution of F&Veg to human health is widely recognized, but the scientific needs that underpin their production, processing and distribution still need elucidation. Scope and approach: A comprehensive exploration of the challenges, future trends and solutions for F&Veg postharvest and processing to counter F&Veg losses and waste, and to promote F&Veg consumption and sustainable development. These encompass many transformative aspects, often facilitated by integration of numerous tools such as human-machine collaboration or intelligent manufacturing. Different scales need to be addressed, such as i) processing operations themselves, with small-scale local innovative processing, design of alternatives to animal products and precision processing, ii) relations with the consumer with traceability systems, personalization, and food sharing, and iii) insertion in the larger scale of bioeconomy. Key findings and conclusions: In the future, the cohesion between processing type, products and consumers should need to be further strengthened to ensure that it meets the more recent demands of the consumer and citizen, such as environmentally friendly and personalized, while the more classical quality traits such as (low) cost, convenience, and taste are preserved and the prerequisites of safety and nutrition are not compromised. This demands a high level of innovation for the entire processing in a short term and it will mean a new balance in F&Veg value chains. The future tasks involve interdisciplinary and cross-border collaboration, and the F&Veg production and processing needs are global, but their application will require different approaches in different regions.

AB Sustainability standards have not yet been commonly adopted by the whole wine chain, and indicator assessments are not widely spread. A deep understanding of how embedding sustainability into business while controlling costs related to the adoption of sustainability certification standards such as data collection and management practices could allow one to overcome most barriers relevant to sustainability compliance. Blockchain technology (BCT) may answer these needs. In order to verify BCT potential to be used as a sustainability management tool in the wine industry, with a qualitative triple bottom line research approach, this article explores the connections among BCT adoption in agri-food, issues posed by wine sustainability certification, and whether wine companies that already own a wine sustainability certification are prepared to adopt it. Results show that (1) the blockchain allows collecting data and information that are relevant for monitoring and improving sustainability: Soil and water features, climate conditions, treatment with pesticides and fertilizers, production process, traceability, transparency, labor and human rights, quality and safety, waste reduction, authenticity, relationship with stakeholders; (2) wine companies that already own a sustainability certification have little familiarity with blockchain applications (57.1%, n.21) and only 14% of the respondents support their intention to invest in BCT in the coming years; (3) the case study shows improvements in traceability and transparency along the supply chain and an increase in consumers' trust that was reflected in sales growth, and the main costs are linked to complexity in data management.

AB Concern regarding chicken meat safety and quality has increased in recent years due to frequent exposure of food-safety-related incidents in Bangladesh. In order to boost consumer confidence, the government of Bangladesh has taken a number of policy measures to improve the safety and quality of fresh foods. Among them, the introduction of fresh food certification is regarded as a critical tool for mitigating threats to food safety. However, little is known about whether Bangladeshi consumers are willing to pay a price premium for certified fresh foods, or what factors influence their willingness to pay (WTP). We particularly investigated consumers' WTP for two types of GLOBALG.A.P. (good agricultural practices) certified chicken (broiler and Sonali chicken) by using contingent valuation method (CVM). A survey was conducted on 384 consumers of Dhaka. Payment card method was employed to elicit WTP. Our findings reveal that consumers are willing to pay a premium of 45.87 BDT/kg (36.69%) for GLOBALG.A.P. certified live broiler and 51.98 BDT/kg (25.99%) for GLOBALG.A.P. certified live Sonali chicken. Interval data regression model was used. The result shows that consumers' age, education, monthly family income, chicken consumption per month and meat safety risk perception had a significant impact on their WTP for both types of chicken while taste was a significant factor only for broiler chicken. Nevertheless, gender, marital status and shopping responsibility had no significant impact on WTP. The findings on WTP for GLOBALG.A.P. certified chicken confirm that the government should introduce certification to meet increasing consumer demand for safe meat.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) has tremendous success in health care, smart city, industrial production and so on. Protected agriculture is one of the fields which has broad application prospects of IoT. Protected agriculture is a mode of highly efficient development of modern agriculture that uses artificial techniques to change climatic factors such as temperature, to create environmental conditions suitable for the growth of animals and plants. This review aims to gain insight into the state-of-the-art of IoT applications in protected agriculture and to identify the system structure and key technologies. Therefore, we completed a systematic literature review of IoT research and deployments in protected agriculture over the past 10 years and evaluated the contributions made by different academicians and organizations. Selected references were clustered into three application domains corresponding to plant management, animal farming and food/agricultural product supply traceability. Furthermore, we discussed the challenges along with future research prospects, to help new researchers of this domain understand the current research progress of IoT in protected agriculture and to propose more novel and innovative ideas in the future.

AB Seed is an important means of production in the process of agricultural production. The quality evaluation, vigor and aging detection, purity and authenticity identification, classification and traceability are common problems in seed quality detection. Seed quality mainly includes the content of moisture, protein, fatty acid, starch, and so forth, which is the important indices of seed quality classification. Moreover, seed quality is related to the safety of storage. Seed vigor is the sum of seed germination and emergence rate, seedling growth potential, plant stress resistance and production potential. High vigor seeds are of obvious growth advantage and production potential. Seed aging refers to the natural decline of seed vigor, which is manifested by seed discoloration, low germination rate, poor growth potential and crop yield reduction. The purity and authenticity of seeds will affect crop yield and agricultural product quality. Seed classification and traceability is an important method to ensure the purity and identify the authenticity of seeds, by which, crop yield and product quality will be guaranteed. For seed quality analysis, it usually need to do irreversible destructive analysis on samples according to the traditional methods, which is time-consuming with complex procedures. It is obvious that traditional methods are difficult to meet the needs of modern agriculture for seed production. Therefore, it is an urgent problem to carry out the research on non-destructive and rapid detection technology of seed quality. In recent years, with the development of chemometrics and the progress of computer technology, near-infrared spectroscopy, with the advantages of fast, non-destructive and high efficiency, has been widely applied in the non-destructive and rapid analysis of agricultural products, food, agricultural inputs, and so on. In addition, combined with spectral and imaging technology, hyperspectral imaging technology is rising in recent years. Compared with the traditional spectral technology, hyperspectral imaging technology can acquire not only the spectral information of the sample but also the spatial distribution information and image characteristics of it. In this paper, based on the near-infrared spectroscopy and hyperspectral imaging technology, the literature of seed quality non-destructive detection from the aspects of seed quality evaluation, vigor and aging detection, purity and authenticity identification, classification and traceability research were reviewed. Based on the analysis of the characteristics of different detection technologies, the problems of seed quality detection are sorted out, respectively. Furthermore, the technical characteristics of non-destructive and rapid detection of seed quality are summarized and prospected.

AB Greenhouse vegetables have been one of the fastest growing and best performing Albanian agrifood subsectors. This paper analyses the current state of coordination and recent developments in the greenhouse vegetable value chain, based on a structured faun survey. The results show that vertical cooperation is not sustainable and most greenhouse vegetable farmers do not use written contracts. Furthermore, most farmers do not carry out soil or water analysis. Albanian farmers do not trust the quality of inputs while claiming that (input) prices are unfair and unreasonable. This is, to a large extent, a result of "spot market" coordination, which cannot guarantee traceability and standards compliance; therefore Contract Farming is the adequate tool to address these gaps.

AB Apart from water, tea is the world's most widely consumed beverage. Tea is produced in more than 50 countries with an annual production of approximately 4.7 million tons. The market segment for specialty tea has been expanding rapidly owing to increased demand, resulting in higher revenues and profits for tea growers and the industry. Accurate varietal identification is critically important to ensure traceability and authentication of premium tea products, which in turn contribute to on-farm conservation of tea genetic diversity. Using a set of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers developed from the expressed sequence tag (EST) database of Camilla senensis, we genotyped deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples extracted from a diverse group of tea varieties, including both fresh and processed commercial loose-leaf teas. The validation led to the designation of 60 SNPs that unambiguously identified all 40 tested tea varieties with high statistical rigor (p<0.0001). Varietal authenticity and genetic relationships among the analyzed cultivars were further characterized by ordination and Bayesian clustering analysis. These SNP markers, in combination with a high-throughput genotyping protocol, effectively established and verified specific DNA fingerprints for all tested tea varieties. This method provides a powerful tool for variety authentication and quality control for the tea industry. It is also highly useful for the management of tea genetic resources and breeding, where accurate and efficient genotype identification is essential.

AB Countrywide pesticide management activities are resource draining, even for developed countries, which sometimes fall short in achieving the optimum protection against pesticides deleterious effects on humans and environment. Additionally, in Lebanon, basic flaws exist at different levels of pesticide management cycle. In this study, through an extensive review of relevant literature regarding the pesticides impact on humans and environment in Lebanon and adopted policies in existing legislation, several gaps have been identified. Accordingly, recommendations to reduce pesticide risk through a combination of reforms at the policy level and its tools, particularly legislation, are proposed. In our opinion, the starting point is to adopt a minimum list of lower risk pesticides supported by a combination of: "prescriptions" based on a comprehensive registration and an effective implementation systems, a suitable IPM/ICM government-supported credit system, traceability systems of agricultural commodities and pesticides containers, Pesticide stock management system to reduce the quantity of obsolete pesticides, and containers recycling system. For a global sustainability of pesticides risk reduction, a binding global intervention fostered by the UN, based on human rights for safe food, is called upon to ban hazardous pesticides-except those of WHO class IV- trafficking in developing countries scoring low in an international official assessment of their pesticides lifecycle management. At the same time, global funds should support pesticides alternatives and the enhancement of the developing countries capacities for pesticides lifecycle management, which is a part of a larger global matrix in risk reduction.

AB For consumers, honey is a natural product that should not be subjected to treatment or alteration. Since the question of the presence of genetically modified organisms concerned pollen in honey, the aim of this research was to find an alternative, however, practical and efficient method of honey and bee pollen DNA extraction for routine analysis application. Furthermore, to evaluate the extracted DNA, a real-time PCR system based on the actin gene was optimized and validated in fast mode for the first time to reduce analysis time. To develop an alternative DNA extraction protocol, two already published procedures were combined and tested with some variations, in particular without beads/filters used to grind/enrich pollen. The best approach found in terms of quantity and quality of extracted DNA was a combination of the pretreatment and the extraction method, described in the German guideline, with some modifications and the addition of a DNA purification kit. This protocol was validated with DNA extracts from honey and bee pollen and it was applied to 18 commercial honey samples. Furthermore, a sample proved positive in transgenic screening elements analysis and for transgenic event identification, a knowledge-based approach was adopted. Since the DNA extraction protocol proved suitable, it could be applied for other analysis such as molecular species characterization, the study of traceability, and environmental monitoring, considering honey as a vector of authorized and not authorized genetically modified organisms.

AB Labeling systems for niche market food products is becoming increasingly important to address consumers' expectations. Yak meat is 'green' product from natural extensive rangeland on Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. A trace technique is essential for consumers to know the origin of yak meat. In the current study, mineral fingerprints were investigated for their potential to classify yak meat according to geographical origin. The concentration of more than 50 mineral contents in 24 yak meat samples from three regions on Qinghai-Tibetan plateau were analyzed by ICP-MS. Multivariate statistical analyses were used to identify the most relevant indicators of origin. Seven elements (Na, As, Ni, Se, Rb, Cd and Ti) were selected for further routine analyses based on the significant origin differences (P<0.05). The three minerals (Se, Rb, Ti) were selected by statistics analysis and established discriminant model for yak meat traceability. Linear discriminate analysis gave an overall correct classification rate of 91.7% and cross-validation rate of 87.5%. These results demonstrate the usefulness of multi-element fingerprints as indicators for authenticating the geographical origin of yak meat.

AB Purpose: Agricultural supply chains witness several challenges, which result in increased cost of operations, high wastages, and low efficiency. In the case of vegetable supply chains (VSCs), the intensity of challenges is very high due to perishability. Literature suggests various operations research tools for supply chain management of perishables, but there is a paucity of research highlighting the real models adopted by real players in the market while making revenue. This paper investigates and presents how a startup can innovate its business model to meet the VSC issues by adopting a single case study methodology.
   Design: The phenomenon was studied by convergent interviewing with the company's key personnel and gathering information from the company's key documents followed by content analysis.
   Findings: The study shows real practices adopted by a startup to cater to the challenges of VSCs in India by incorporating various tools of productivity enhancement and waste reduction. It highlights the adoption of a traceability system, production planning mechanism, reduced food miles, and green initiatives contributing to an innovative business model. The study maps the business model of the startup with the business model concept provided by Lindgardt and colleagues [2009] and states two more dimensions, i.e. "Client relationship management" and "Sustainability activities" to expand the mentioned configuration. Originality: The study is the first of its kind to highlight the Business Model Innovation of a startup to address the VSC challenges in the Indian context.
   Practical contribution: The study has important managerial implications useful for finding our new value propositions in a VSC firm by shortening and effectively integrating the supply chain while minimizing information asymmetry to achieve economies and sustainability.
   Theoretical contribution: This study has strengthened the methodological advances in the study of business models based upon earlier validated configurations. It contributes to the extant research by adding two more elements "Client relationship management" and "Sustainability activities" in a business model configuration.

AB The portable device could help to obtain a complete follow-up of fruit quality in orchards and during post-harvest. Thus, it is an important step to develop portable and non-destructive technology for current and future research in fruit. In this study, the ability of portable visible-near infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy to non-invasively determine sugar content in pear was studied. Partial least square regression (PLSR) was applied to establish calibration models based on the spectral signatures of three regions (550-1050, 650-950, 750-1050nm) and four types of data sets (Set-I, Set-II, Set-III, and Set-IV), respectively, and the performance of models was compared to determine the optimal spectral calibration strategy. The spectral region of 650-950nm was proved to be much better compared with other two spectral regions. Competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) algorithm was used to reduce redundancy and collinearity of the original spectral data based on the optimal spectral region for selecting the most important wavelengths. The CARS-PLSR was identified as the most effective method to calibrate the prediction models for sugar content determination, resulting in good coefficient of determination for prediction (RP2) of 0.85-0.92 and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.27-0.20 for four types of data sets, respectively. The overall results show that the portable Vis-NIR spectroscopy is a promising tool for the non-destructive on-site evaluation of sugar content in pear, as well as affording the additional advantage of low cost.

AB Issues related to food authenticity, traceability, and fraud have increased in recent decades as a consequence of the deliberate and intentional substitution, addition, tampering, or misrepresentation of food ingredients, where false or misleading statements are made about a product for economic gains. This study aimed to evaluate the ability of a portable NIR instrument to classify egg samples sourced from different provenances or production systems (e.g., cage and free-range) in Australia. Whole egg samples (n: 100) were purchased from local supermarkets where the label in each of the packages was used as identification of the layers' feeding system as per the Australian legislation and standards. The spectra of the albumin and yolk were collected using a portable NIR spectrophotometer (950-1600 nm). Principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were used to analyze the NIR data. The results obtained in this study showed how the combination of chemometrics and NIR spectroscopy allowed for the classification of egg albumin and yolk samples according to the system of production (cage and free range). The proposed method is simple, fast, environmentally friendly and avoids laborious sample pre-treatment, and is expected to become an alternative to commonly used techniques for egg quality assessment.

AB The assignment of an individual to the true population of origin is one of the most important applications of genomic data for practical use in animal breeding. The aim of this study was to develop a statistical method and then, to identify the minimum number of informative SNP markers from high-throughput genotyping data that would be able to trace the true breed of unknown samples in indigenous sheep breeds. The total numbers of 217 animals were genotyped using Illumina OvineSNP50K BeadChip in Zel, Lori-Bakhtiari, Afshari, Moqani, Qezel and a wild-type Iranian sheep breed. After SNP quality check, the principal component analysis (PCA) was used to determine how the animals allocated to the groups using all genotyped markers. The results revealed that the first principal component (PC1) separated out the two domestic and wild sheep breeds, and all domestic breeds were separated from each other for PC2. The genetic distance between different breeds was calculated using F-ST and Reynold methods and the results showed that the breeds were well differentiated. A statistical method was developed using the stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA) and the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to reduce the number of SNPs for discriminating 6 different Iranian sheep populations and K-fold cross-validation technique was employed to evaluate the potential of a selected subset of SNPs in assignment success rate. The procedure selected reduced pools of markers into 201 SNPs that were able to exactly discriminate all sheep populations with 100% accuracy. Moreover, a discriminate analysis of principal components (DAPC) developed using 201 linearly independent SNPs revealed that these markers were able to assign all individuals into true breed. Finally, these 201 identified SNPs were successfully used in an independent out-group breed consisting of 96 samples of Baluchi sheep breed and the results indicated that these markers are able to correctly allocate all unknown samples to true population of origin. In general, the results of this study indicated that the combined use of the SDA and LDA techniques represents an efficient strategy for selecting a reduced pool of highly discriminant markers.

AB The purpose of this study was to construct the DNA fingerprinting and query system with which to identify mung bean varieties from Northeast China. Eight primer pairs for fluorescent-labeled simple sequence repeat markers with high polymorphism and a strong discrimination ability were used to detect 151 mung bean varieties from Northeast China. A total of 59 bands were detected, ranging from 4 to 11 with an average of 7.4. An unweighted pair group method analysis was used to cluster the mung bean varieties into five separate groups according to their genetic characteristics, which were consistent with the results of principal component analysis. Unique identification cards and barcodes with which each variety can be identified were established according to fingerprinting. A query system was also established which can provide the information and genetic relationships among some indefinite variety and mung bean varieties from Northeast China. This research will significantly assist in identification, traceability management, protection of origin, and intellectual property rights. It will also provide essential technical support for revealing the level of genetic diversity for breeding and germplasm innovation of mung bean varieties in Northeast China.

AB Inorganic components have been widely applied as geographical traceability biomarkers of plant derived food and phytophagous insects.Helicoverpa armigera(H. armigera) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), a global economic pest, has been shown to be able to migrate long distances but the detailed migration paths are still unclear. Herein, the levels of 10 minerals (Mg, Al, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Cr and Sr) in 32H. armigeraadults from different growing backgrounds were evaluated by inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The discrimination of these insects from five groups was realized by using principal component analysis (PCA) and canonical discriminant analysis (CDA). The results showed thatH. armigerafrom different growing backgrounds discriminated by PCA and CDA achieved high accuracy values of 84.4% and 100.0%, respectively. Additionally, cross-validation was utilized to check the confidence of the CDA results with an accuracy of 81.3%. The present study shows that geographical discrimination established by chemometric analytical methods achieves high confidence in terms of the identification of the phytophagous insectH. armigera. The application of this pattern may contribute to resolving migratory insect issues in the near future.

AB Fresh fruit and vegetables are a major source of biologically active compounds essential for human wellbeing. They are, however, perishable living products that require coordinated actions by growers, storage operators, processors, and retailers to maintain their quality and reduce food loss and waste. Recent advances in shelf life extension have been achieved by the combination of treatments including suitable temperature, humidity, and gas composition that maintain their quality and safety. Fresh produce attributes such as appearance, texture, flavour and nutritional value have been traditional quality criteria, but increasingly safety and traceability are important for all the role players along the supply chain from the farm to consumer. Non-destructive techniques for analysing the quality of fresh produce are valuable tools applicable along the supply chain. Advances in optical methods were touched in this perspective article pointing to new methods to inform the user. Quality deterioration and microbial contamination leading to spoilage and postharvest losses can occur at any of the supply chain stages. Therefore, postharvest treatments are essential to minimise quality loss, microbial spoilage and reduce the risk of pathogen contamination. Various postharvest physical, chemical and gaseous treatments can be applied to maintain fresh-like quality without compromising the sensory and nutritional aspects. The consequences of these techniques on quality and safety of fresh horticultural commodities are highlighted in this paper. Future research should aim at improving organoleptic quality and meeting safety standards of fresh produce at all steps of the supply chain.

AB Over the past few years several private voluntary schemes have been developed worldwide to address the environmental issues in the forest based industry. Using survey data, this study analyse the main factors motivating companies operating in the Italian forest based industry to implement FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) standard, as a tool to promote responsible forest management and traceability of derived products, and the impact of this standard on the economic and organisational results. The findings provide evidences that signalling mechanisms drive the entrepreneurs towards the adoption of FSC certification, followed by moral and ethical reasons. In terms of impact, emerges that companies are compared to higher operation costs necessary to obtain the certification of compliance with the scheme requirements, that are only partially compensated, not by an increase in the selling price of certified products, but by the company's ability to establish new business relationships with a consequent increase in the sales.

AB BACKGROUND The fluorescence sensing method has been increasingly applied in food quality control because it is fast and sensitive. However, its application in quality evaluation is challenging. Using Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium (CRP; dried mandarin orange peel) as an example, we developed a simple and low-cost fluorescence sensing strategy based on nanoparticles combined with spectral splicing and chemometrics for quality evaluation. This method can recognize Citrus reticulata 'Chachi' (CRC) from other CRP cultivars and further identify the storage year.
   RESULTS Nanogold particles and cadmium telluride quantum dots were selected as nanosensors and mixed with aqueous extracts of CRP separately to produce fluorescence quenching spectra. Then, a simple spectral splicing procedure was applied to obtain spliced spectra comprising different combinations of the self-fluorescence and fluorescence quenching spectra of CRP samples. With the aid of partial least-squares discriminant analysis, the new strategy achieved recognition rates of 100% in distinguishing CRC samples from other CRP samples, as well as recognition rates of 100% for the training set and 98.04% for the prediction set in the discrimination of the storage year of CRC. The recognition mechanism is dominated by interactions between the nanoparticles and the fluorescent components in the CRP samples, but other components also have concurrent effects.
   CONCLUSIONS This novel fluorescence sensing strategy not only provides a new tool for the quality evaluation of CRC but also has good prospects for the authentication and traceability of other foods and herbs. Crucially, the developed method is convenient, simple and effective. (c) 2020 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Fresh garlic scape is popular for its unique tastes and special antibacterial effect. As a kind of seasonal vegetable, it has huge quality decay after harvesting, and usually by low temperature storage to approach the round-year supply. However, it lacks cold chain management directions and transparency, which depends heavily on the real-time information of the process environments and the quality of fresh garlic scapes. With the analyzed quality-related indicators, including temperature, relative humidity, gas composition and vibration, a multi-sensors information acquisition system based on wireless sensor network was designed and developed. Then, the process of the fresh garlic scapes supply were systematically analyzed and identified, and the proposed system was also evaluated using the monitored data in current practices. Results show that the transportation and cold storage occupies an important position in the typical garlic scapes supply process, which has continuous influences on the quality preservation. The developed system functions well, and the wireless multi-sensors nodes can real-time monitor environmental information with high data reliability. The data evaluation also demonstrates the association of the monitored quality-related data with the supply process stage. Meanwhile, it is the visualization of the quality-related data that enhance the real-time sensing of the quality in storage, the transparency of the supply process and the cold chain management level. Furthermore, the system should be further enhanced with the better data quality acquired by the nodes for better quality sensing and management of the fresh garlic scapes supply process. Practical Applications Significant benefits of this work are anticipated on the postharvest and preservation of garlic scapes to the market and reduction of its losses in the postharvest chain.

AB As an essential factor in quality assessment of maize seeds, variety purity profoundly impacts final yield and farmers' economic benefits. In this study, a novel method based on Raman hyperspectral imaging system was applied to achieve variety classification of coated maize seeds. A total of 760 maize seeds including 4 different varieties were evaluated. Raman spectral data of 400-1800 cm(-1) were extracted and preprocessed. Variable selection methods involved were modified competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (MCARS), successive projections algorithm (SPA), and their combination. In addition, MCARS was proposed for the first time in this paper as a stable search technology. The performance of support vector machine (SVM) models optimized by genetic algorithm (GA) was analyzed and compared with models based on random forest (RF) and back-propagation neural network (BPNN). Same models based on Vis-NIR spectral data were also established for comparison. Results showed that the MCARS-GA-SVM model based on Raman spectral data obtained the best performance with calibration accuracy of 99.29% and prediction accuracy of 100%, which were stable and easily replicated. In addition, the accuracy on the independent validation set was 96.88%, which proved that the model can be applied in practice. A more simplified MCARS-SPA-GA-SVM model, which contained only 3 variables, had more than 95% accuracy on each data set. This procedure can help to develop a real-time detection system to classify coated seed varieties with high accuracy, which is of great significance for assessing variety purity and increasing crop yield.

AB The metabolic pigment composition of Sangiovese wines produced from grapes harvested at 20 different vineyards in Montalcino over three consecutive years (2008-2010) on a semi-industrial scale and of 55 commercial Brunello di Montalcino wines (2004-2007) was studied, using a targeted method capable of analyzing 90 pigments in an 11 min UHPLC-MS/MS chromatographic run. Interesting correlations were shown between various pigments formed during wine aging and those present in Sangiovese grapes. Vitisin B-like pigment and vitisin A-like pigment concentrations would seem to have a good correlation with ethyl-linked and direct-linked flavanol anthocyanin concentrations, respectively. Moreover, the anthocyanic pattern recognition, genetically controlled by the plant variety, was shown to be inherited by the pigments formed during wine aging.

AB Pinus pinea L is one of the most important nut species in the world given the high nutritional and culinary value of its seed, the pine nuts, with increasing demand. The objective of this study was to assess the potential of visible and near infrared spectroscopy (VIS + NIRS) to analyse different sample presentations and to discriminate geographical origins of Mediterranean pine nut grown in Chile. Pine nuts were collected from 76 adult trees in three grovith macrozones previously defined for stone pine in Chile. Original spectroscopic data were obtained by means of a Foss NIRSystems 6500 SYII spectrophotometer using a transport module. Reflectance was employed in the wavelength range of 400-2500 nm. The best means of sampling for the pine nuts used in this study were also studied. After analysing the spectroscopic data, discriminant models were obtained by means of discriminant partial least square (DPLS) with all samples. For the three macrozones previously identified, 87.8% of samples was correctly classified in the cross validation stage with the best model for pine nuts spectra analysis, obtained with shelled intact pine nuts. Results indicate that NIRS technology is capable of differentiating between pine nut samples of different geographical origins with errors ranging between 12.2 and 9.2%, and demonstrate the potential of VIS NIRS technology as a rapid and accurate method for predicting the geographical origin of Mediterranean pine nuts.

AB The traditional meat and poultry farms use a fixed quantity of supply, which creates an imbalance between demand and supply. Due to this imbalance, a huge amount is spent on balancing the requirements. There is an inequality among demand and supply since typical meat and poultry farms use a fixed amount of supply. A lot of money is spent trying to balance the requirements because of this mismatch. In addition, when connecting and building the meat and poultry farm system, the procedure ignores the impact on the environment. The owner's primary goals are to retain massive profits and raise reliability. The classical method neglects the effect on the environment while linking and designing the meat and poultry farm system. The main aim of the owner is to increase the quality and maintain the maximum profit. This paper deals with the meat and poultry farms in two folds. In the first step, the IoT based system is implemented for the traceability and demand-supply monitoring. The second steps include optimization of the supply network to reduce the carbon emission from the transportation. Both steps take data analytics as an input to process the final result for the farm to run and optimize. Effective inventory optimization algorithms have been shown to be able to evaluate a significant portion of previous sales data and anticipate inventory future demand by taking seasonality and lead times into account. Revenue, productivity, and customer satisfaction are just a few of the business variables that these strategies may affect. Finally, the comparison is done with the traditional farm and supply chain on the points of demand-supply balance, cost, carbon emission, and wastage. It is found that the farms using data analytics to optimize the overall system perform better and with 37% more efficient than the traditional systems.

AB A porcine fat sample taken as part of the national residues monitoring programme in 2008 led to the detection of a major feed contamination incidence in the Republic of Ireland. The source of the contamination was traced back to the use of contaminated oil in a direct-drying feed operation system. Congener profiles in animal fat and feed samples showed a high level of consistency and pinpointed the likely source of fuel contamination to be a highly chlorinated commercial PCB mixture.

AB This paper proposes an approach to predict the efficiency of forced-air cooling of fresh apples that combines the optimized differential evolution (DE) algorithm and the back-propagation (BP) neural network algorithm. First, to balance population diversity and fast convergence, the individual mutation operation of the basic DE algorithm was optimized by dividing the entire population into two equal parts according to the fitness value of individuals, and DE-best-1 and DE-current-to-rand-1 are used as individual mutation operations for the superior- and inferior-part individuals, respectively. Moreover, the selection operation of basic DE was also changed by using a crowding scheme, which helps maintain population diversity and discover more regions containing the global optima. Second, an optimized DE-BP neural network model was established by using the optimized DE to determine the initial weights and thresholds of the BP neural network to avoid being trapped in local minima, following which the effect of input parameters on the network output was subjected to a comprehensive sensitivity analysis based on the trained neural network. The results show that the optimized DE-BP model accurately predicts the efficiency with which apples are cooled. Furthermore, the airflow velocity and total opening area have a significant negative correlation with the average apple temperature and a positive correlation with the cooling rate of the apples. Finally, the most important factor influencing the cooling efficiency of the pre-cooling system is the total opening area of the ventilated packaging. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Much of the world's rangelands contribute to food production through extensive grazing systems. In these systems, livestock producers, pastoralists, and ranchers move grazing animals to access variable feed and water resources to create value while supporting numerous other ecosystem services. Loss of mobility due to political, social, ecological, and economic factors is documented throughout the world and poses a substantial risk to rangeland livestock production and conservation of rangeland resources. The integration of production-scapes can facilitate livestock mobility through transportation and trade. This paper describes the beef cattle production system in California, where transporting and marketing animals integrate an extensive grazing system with intensive production systems, including feeding operations. Analysis of livestock inspection data quantifies the magnitude of livestock movements in the state and the scope of production-system integration. Over 500,000 head-47 percent of the state's calf crop-leave California rangelands and are moved to new pastures or feedyards seasonally over a 12 week period each year. Most ranchers in California, from small-scale producers (1 to 50 head) to larger producers (more than 5,000), participate in the integrated beef production system. Less than 1% of steers and heifers go from rangeland to meat processing. Like pastoralists, ranchers strategically move cattle around (and off) rangeland to optimize production within a variable climate. Ranchers indicate that their movements result from changes in forage quality and quantity and support their desire to manage for conservation objectives, including reducing fire fuels, controlling weeds, and managing for wildlife habitat. Inspection data, as well as direct observation, interviews, and surveys within the San Francisco Bay area, reveal the extent to which the region's ranchers rely on saleyards to facilitate the movement of cattle and integration of production systems. Saleyards and cattle buyers drive beef production efficiency by sorting, pricing, and moving cattle and matching them to feed resources in more intensive production systems. However, transactions lack traceability to inform policy and consumer choice. New data technologies like blockchain can provide traceability through integrated production-scapes and facilitate market development to support grazing landscapes and consumer choice.

AB There are few traceability systems other than genetic markers capable of distinguishing between sea products of; different origin and quality. Here, we address the potential of stable isotopes combined with metabolic and growth parameters as a discriminatory tool for the selection of fish seeds with high growth capacity. For this purpose, sea bream fingerlings produced in three hatcheries (Spanish Mediterranean coast, MC; Cantabrian coast, CC; and South-Iberian Atlantic coast, AC) were subjected to isotopic analysis (delta N-15 and delta C-13), and indices of growth (RNA and DNA) and energy metabolism [cytochrome-c-oxidase (COX) and citrate synthase (CS) activities] were calculated. These analyses were performed prior to and after a "homogenization" period of 35 days under identical rearing conditions. After this period, fingerlings were discriminated between hatcheries, with isotopic measures (especially delta N-15), metabolic parameters (COX and CS), and proximal composition (fat content) in muscle providing the highest discriminatory capacity. Therefore, particular rearing conditions and/or genetic divergence between hatcheries, affecting the growth capacity of fingerlings, are defined mainly by the isotopic imprint. Moreover, the muscle isotopic signature is a more suitable indicator than whole fish for discrimination purposes.

ID TRACEABILITY; MANAGEMENT; TAGS
AB In the food industry, composition, size, and shape of items are much less regular than in other commodities sectors. In addition, a wide variety of packaging, composed by different materials, is employed. As material, size and shape of items to which the tag should be attached strongly influence the minimum power requested for tag functioning, performance improvements can be achieved only selecting suitable radio frequency (RF) identifiers for the specific combination of food product and packaging. When dealing with logistics units, the dynamic reading of a vast number of tags could originate simultaneous broadcasting of signals (tag-to-tag collisions) that could affect reading rates and the overall reliability of the identification procedure. This paper reports the results of an analysis of the reading performance of ultra high frequency radio frequency identification systems for multiple static and dynamic electronic identification of food packed products in controlled conditions. Products were considered when arranged on a logistics pallet. The effects on reading rate of different factors, among which the product type, the gate configuration, the field polarisation, the power output of the RF reader, the interrogation protocol configuration as well as the transit speed, the number of tags and their interactions were statistically analysed and compared.

AB The growing concerns about the quality and safety of herbs and spices among consumers have increased the demand for technical testing. Recently, non-destructive analysis techniques have been widely studied and applied. Generally, a single technology has certain limitations, which are not enough to fully describe the characteristics of complex products (dynamic or complex structure). Combining non-destructive analysis tech-nology (multi-source information) can overcome the above problems. The present review focused on applying multi-source and non-destructive information on herbs and spices quality authentication, including vibration spectroscopy and electronic sensor technologies. Then summarized and analyzed the authentication process for issues such as adulteration, contents prediction, geographical traceability, process and products analysis, and identification variety. Additionally, we presented trends in quality authentication, discussed the challenges and prospects, and made recommendations. This investigation provided clear evidence for the superiority of the quality authentication methods for herbs and spices based on multi-source and non-destructive information.

AB Individual identification plays an important part in disease prevention and control, traceability of meat products, and improvement of agricultural false insurance claims. Automatic and accurate detection of cattle face is prior to individual identification and facial expression recognition based on image analysis technology. This paper evaluated the possibility of the cutting-edge object detection algorithm, RetinaNet, performing multi-view cattle face detection in housing farms with fluctuating illumination, overlapping, and occlusion. Seven different pretrained CNN models (ResNet 50, ResNet 101, ResNet 152, VGG 16, VGG 19, Densenet 121 and Densenet 169) were fine-tuned by transfer learning and re-trained on the dataset in the paper. Experimental results showed that RetinaNet incorporating the ResNet 50 was superior in accuracy and speed through performance evaluation, which yielded an average precision score of 99.8% and an average processing time of 0.0438 s per image. Compared with the typical competing algorithms, the proposed method was preferable for cattle face detection, especially in particularly challenging scenarios. This research work demonstrated the potential of artificial intelligence towards the incorporation of computer vision systems for individual identification and other animal welfare improvements.

TI Methodological Framework for World Health Organization Estimates of the
   Global Burden of Foodborne Disease
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS; DISABILITY WEIGHTS
AB Background
   The Foodborne Disease Burden Epidemiology Reference Group (FERG) was established in 2007 by the World Health Organization to estimate the global burden of foodborne diseases (FBDs). This paper describes the methodological framework developed by FERG's Computational Task Force to transform epidemiological information into FBD burden estimates.
   Methods and Findings
   The global and regional burden of 31 FBDs was quantified, along with limited estimates for 5 other FBDs, using Disability-Adjusted Life Years in a hazard-and incidence-based approach. To accomplish this task, the following workflow was defined: outline of disease models and collection of epidemiological data; design and completion of a database template; development of an imputation model; identification of disability weights; probabilistic burden assessment; and estimating the proportion of the disease burden by each hazard that is attributable to exposure by food (i.e., source attribution). All computations were performed in R and the different functions were compiled in the R package 'FERG'. Traceability and transparency were ensured by sharing results and methods in an interactive way with all FERG members throughout the process.
   Conclusions
   We developed a comprehensive framework for estimating the global burden of FBDs, in which methodological simplicity and transparency were key elements. All the tools developed have been made available and can be translated into a user-friendly national toolkit for studying and monitoring food safety at the local level.

AB In recent years, adulteration of meat and meat products has become a major food safety issue. PCR and real-time PCR technologies are mainstream methods used to identify animal-derived components. However, these technologies rely highly on costly equipment and professional technicians; they are therefore difficult to use in resource-limited settings. In this study, a novel, highly sensitive molecular assay, Pig-PCR-Strip (Pig specific polymerase chain reaction-Lateral flow strip), was developed for rapid detection of pig and swine-derived components. The assay is based on PCR amplification, hybridization of the PCR product to the probe, followed by detection using a strip format. Using this format, the PCR product can be detected by the naked eye within 3 min, and provides a basis for the migration of species-specific detection to a point-of-care (POC) microfluidic format. The Pig-PCR-Strip can detect pork components at a concentration of 0.01% in adulterated meat, and the limit of detection is up to 10 fg of target DNA. The assay was specific to pork and did not cross-react with other non-target species. It also can be used for commercial samples and complex food samples. It is a promising new tool for detection of pig-derived meat and can be rapidly modified for identifying other species. It could be widely used for solving problems related to meat quality assurance, species authentication, and traceability.

AB Carbon emissions from the production of beef account for the majority of carbon emissions from animal husbandry, and animal husbandry, in turn, is the main driver of global carbon emissions. At present, there are relatively few studies of consumer preferences for beef substitutes, especially in developing countries. However, plant-based meat is of great significance in solving the tense relationship between supply and demand, ensuring sustainable development, further improving food safety, and improving animal welfare. Based on survey data from 1146 consumers in Liaoning province, China, this paper adopts the choice experiment method to study consumer preferences and willingness to pay for four types of plant-based beef patty product attributes, traceability, safety certification, brand, and price, using the multivariate logit (MNL) model. The results show that consumers show greater preference and willingness to pay for plant-based beef patties with strong traceability, fully disclosed safety certification information, and mature production technology. Consumers generally have strong brand preferences, while there are some differences in preference for other product attributes. In addition, environmentally-focused consumers have a greater degree of preference for traceable products. This study explores the micro decision mechanism of the purchase of plant-based meat products in developing countries. The research conclusions of this paper have guiding significance for businesses engaged in plant-based meat production and processing because of the addition and use of attribute tags. This study also has reference significance for the regulatory standards of decision-making departments and government investment.

AB An electronic toll collection (ETC) system is one of the most important parts of an intelligent transportation system (ITS), but existing ETC systems are not efficient and have vehicle fee evasion complications. Owing to the traceability and tamper resistance of a blockchain, the combination of a blockchain and ETC system is a feasible way to solve the above problems. However, traditional blockchain (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum) has high power consumption and low efficiency. Hence, it cannot be used in ETC systems with high throughput and is not suitable for power-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In this study, therefore, we propose a blockchain architecture for the ETC system. To curb vehicle fee evasion behavior, thereby reducing the economic loss caused, we propose a vehicle behavior management mechanism based on credit value. Furthermore, to reduce the burden of storage and build a chain of evidence for auditing purposes, we propose an evidence chain framework. To protect the data security in the transaction process, we designed a data protection method to encrypt the transaction data. Additionally, this system is based on an open-source alliance blockchain framework called Hyperledger Fabric, which is more in line with the current application scenarios of ETC systems. We implemented the system on a Raspberry Pi and carried out simulations. The comprehensive evaluation results and analysis show that the system effectively reduces the number of illegal acts, completes the evidence inspection, and improves the security of the data.

AB In 2004, the Thai government enacted a food safety policy, 'from-farm-to-table', to ensure food safety throughout the food chain. Several food safety assurance systems such as good agricultural practices (GAP) are employed to control and monitor food safety. Nevertheless, a lack of confidence in food safety of products in the domestic market still exists. This study aimed to describe and analyse the current situation of GAP standards implemented in fresh produce production in Thailand. A mixed explorative and descriptive approach was used by reviewing literature and using multidimensional scaling to draw a subjective perceptual map of the relative position of the set of GAP standards adopted in Thailand. Food safety law and regulations were discussed with a comparative analysis of the three kinds of GAP standards applied in Thailand. The subjective perceptual map of the different GAP standards shows that the standards may be positioned with reference to two dimensions: 'trustworthiness' and 'usefulness for the business'. The problem of GAP implementation in Thailand is rooted in a lack of knowledge and understanding of principles and the perception of advantages of GAP adoption among stakeholders. The national GAP of Thailand, Q-GAP, is the most widely adopted standard. However, improvement of credibility of this standard is urgently required.

AB The radiogenic isotopic compositions of inorganic heavy elements such as Sr, Nd, and Pb of the food chain may constitute a reliable geographic fingerprint, their isotopic ratios being inherited by the geological substratum of the territory of production. The Sr isotope composition of geomaterials (i.e., rocks and soils) is largely variable, and it depends upon the age of the rocks and their nature (e.g., genesis, composition). In this study we developed a high-precision analytical procedure for determining Sr isotopes in wines at comparable uncertainty levels of geological data. With the aim of verifying the possibility of using Sr isotope in wine as a reliable tracer for geographic provenance, we performed Sr isotope analyses of 45 bottled wines from four different geographical localities of the Italian peninsula. Their Sr isotope composition has been compared with that of rocks from the substrata (i.e., rocks) of their vineyards. In addition wines from the same winemaker but different vintage years have been analyzed to verify the constancy with time of the Sr-87/Sr-86. Sr isotope compositions have been determined by solid source thermal ionization mass spectrometry following purification of Sr in a clean laboratory. Sr-87/Sr-68 of the analyzed wines is correlated with the isotopic values of the geological substratum of the vineyards, showing little or no variation within the same vineyard and among different vintages. Large Sr-87/Sr-86 variation is observed among wines from the different geographical areas, reinforcing the link with the geological substratum of the production territory. This makes Sr isotopes a robust geochernical tool for tracing the geographic authenticity and provenance of wine.

AB Featured Application This article discusses the preparation of CO2 micro-nanobubble water using the dissolved gas release method. Taking the CO2 content as the optimization target, micro-nanobubble water was prepared with the optimal content based on a mathematical model constructed using the response surface method. Meanwhile, the characteristics of the micro-nanobubbles in the water provided a theoretical reference for applying CO2 in agriculture, which will assist in achieving a quantitative increase in the CO2 enrichment of crops. Carbon dioxide (CO2) enrichment in an agricultural environment has been shown to enhance the efficiency of crop photosynthesis, increasing crop yield and product quality. There is a problem of the excessive use of CO2 gas when the CO2 is enriched for crops, such as soybean and other field crops. Given the application of micro-nanobubbles (MNBs) in agricultural production, this research takes CO2 as the gas source to prepare the micro-nanobubble water by the dissolved gas release method, and the response surface methodology is used to optimize the preparation process. The results show that the optimum parameters, which are the gas-liquid ratio, generator running time, and inlet water temperature for the preparation of CO2 micro-nanobubble water, are 2.87%, 28.47 min, and 25.52 degrees C, respectively. The CO2 content in the MNB water prepared under the optimum parameters is 7.64 mg/L, and the pH is 4.08. Furthermore, the particle size of the bubbles is mostly 255.5 nm. With the extension of the storage time, some of the bubbles polymerize and spill out, but there is still a certain amount of nanoscale bubbles during a certain period. This research provides a new idea for using MNB technology to increase the content and lifespan of CO2 in water, which will slow the release and increase the utilization of CO2 when using CO2 enrichment in agriculture.

AB Release of various genetically modified organisms (GMOs) into market during the past decade contributes to concerns regarding the traceability of food and feed products. In this study, a comprehensive list of inserted elements of commercialized GMOs has been collected, which contained information of 191 singular genetically modified (GM) varieties. Several elements were selected to develop a universal analytical approach for screening GM presence in food and feed products. This approach achieved coverage of those singular GM events as well as their hybrid crosses. The developed screening approach showed great specificity and sensitivity of less than 25 copies that meet the labeling demands for all countries. Moreover, microfluidic chip and digital PCR were combined in this approach to detect GM varieties and estimate GM content, both of which achieved high-throughput and accurate identification of unauthorized GMOs. Overall, this new analytical approach will serve as a functional tool for accurate control of authorized and unauthorized GMOs.

AB Water stress status of plants is very important for irrigation scheduling. However, plant water stress status monitoring has become the bottleneck of irrigation scheduling. In this study, an automatic water stress status monitoring method for strawberry plant was proposed and realized using combined RGB and infrared image information. RGB image and infrared images were obtained using RGB digital camera and infrared thermal camera, which were placed in a fixed shell in parallel. In the first experimental stage, three kinds of water stress treatments were carried out on three groups of strawberry plants, and each group includes three repetitions. Single point plant temperature, dry surface temperature, wet surface temperature were measured. In the second experimental stage, the infrared and visible light images of the canopy leaves were obtained. Meanwhile, plant temperature, dry surface temperature, wet surface temperature, and stomatal conductance were measured not only for single point but also for plant area temperature measurement. Fusion information of infrared image and visible light image was analyzed using image processing technology, to calculate the average temperature of plant areas. Based on single point temperature, area temperature, dry surface temperature and wet surface temperature of the plant, single point crop water stress index (CWSI) and area CWSI were calculated. Through analysis of variance (ANOVA), the experimental results showed that CWSI measured for plants under different treatments, were significantly different. Through correlation analysis, the experimental results showed that, determination coefficient between area CWSI and the corresponding stomatal conductance of three strawberry groups were 0.8834, 0.8730 and 0.8851, respectively, which were larger than that of single-point CWSI and stomatal conductance. The results showed that area CWSI is more suitable to be used as the criteria for automatic diagnosis of plants.

AB The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused several negative impacts on global human health and the world's economy. Food and seafood safety and security were among the principal challenges and causes of concern for the food industry and consumers during the spread of this global pandemic. This article focused on the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on potential safety issues with seafood products and their processing methods. Moreover, the potential impacts of coronavirus transmission through seafood on human health were evaluated. The role of authenticity, traceability, and antimicrobials from natural sources to preserve seafood and the possible interaction of functional foods on the human immune system are also discussed. Although seafood is not considered a principal vector of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the possible infections through contaminated surfaces of such food products cannot be neglected. The positive effects of seafood consumption on possible immunity built up, and COVID-19 are also summarized.

AB Food safety and quality assurance are increasingly a major issue with the globalisation of agricultural trade, on the one hand, and intensification of agriculture, on the other. Consumer protection has become a priority in policy-making amongst the large economies of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries following a number of food safety incidents. To enhance food safety, it is necessary to establish markets underpinned by knowledge and resources, including analysis of international rejections of food products from MENA countries, international laboratory accreditation, improved reporting systems and traceability, continued development and validation of analytical methods, and more work on correlating sensory evaluation with analytical results. MENA countries should develop a national strategy for food safety based on a holistic approach that extends fromfarm-to-fork and involves all the relevant stakeholders. Accordingly, food safety should be a regional programme, raising awareness among policy-and decision-makers of the importance of food safety and quality for consumer protection, food trade and economic development.

AB In many countries, ractopamine hydrochloride (RAC) is allowed to be used in animal production as a -agonist, which is an energy repartitioning agent able to offer economic benefits such as increased muscle and decreased fat deposition, feed conversion improvement and an increase in average daily weight gain. However, some countries have banned its use and established strict traceability programmes because of pharmacological implications of -agonist residues in meat products. In Brazil, commercial RAC is controlled (5-20 mgkg(-1)) and only added to pig diet during the last 28days before slaughter. However, the control is more difficult when co-products, like meat and bone meal (MBM), which can be produced from RAC treated animals, are part of the feed composition. Therefore, a study was undertaken to evaluate the presence of RAC residue concentrations in urine and tissues of gilts (n =40) in four dietary groups: 0%, 7%, 14% and 21% (w/w) of MBM-containing RAC (53.5 mu g kg(-1)). The concentration of RAC residues in MBM, pig tissues and urine was determined by LC-MS. Low RAC concentrations were detected in muscle, kidney, liver and lungs (limit of detection=0.15, 0.5, 0.5 and 1.0 mu g kg(-1), respectively); however, no RAC residues were quantified above the limit of quantification (0.5, 2.5, 2.5 and 2.5 mu g kg(-1), respectively). In urine, the RAC concentration remained below 1.35 mu gL(-1). These data suggest that MBM (containing 53.5 mu g kg(-1) RAC) added to diet up to 21% (w/w) could hamper the trade where RAC is restricted or has zero-tolerance policy.

AB Over the last decades, olive oil quality and authenticity control has become an issue of great importance to consumers, suppliers, retailers, and regulators in both traditional and emerging olive oil producing countries, mainly due to the increasing worldwide popularity and the trade globalization of this product. Thus, in order to ensure olive oil authentication, various national and international laws and regulations have been adopted, although some of them are actually causing an enormous debate about the risk that they can represent for the harmonization of international olive oil trade standards. Within this context, this review was designed to provide a critical overview and comparative analysis of selected regulatory frameworks for olive oil authentication, with special emphasis on the quality and purity criteria considered by these regulation systems, their thresholds and the analytical methods employed for monitoring them. To complete the general overview, recent analytical advances to overcome drawbacks and limitations of the official methods to evaluate olive oil quality and to determine possible adulterations were reviewed. Furthermore, the latest trends on analytical approaches to assess the olive oil geographical and varietal origin traceability were also examined.

AB The objective of this study is to explore the current strategies available to monitor and detect the economically and criminally motivated adulteration of food, identifying their strengths and weaknesses and recommend new approaches and policies to strengthen future capabilities to counter adulteration in a globalized food environment. There are many techniques used to detect the presence of adulterants, however this approach relies on the adulterant or means of substitution being "known" and no food item can ever be declared truly free of adulteration on that basis. Further techniques will verify the provenance claims made about a food product e.g. breed, variety etc. as well as techniques to identify original geographic location of food production. These consider wholeness, or not, of a food item and do not need to necessarily identify the actual adulterant. The conceptual framework developed in this research focuses on the process of predicting, detecting and reacting to economically and criminally motivated food adulteration. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Over the past few years, public attention has focused on the quality and safety control, traceability, and environmental issues surrounding food products. Several mandatory public standards and private voluntary schemes worldwide have been developed to address these concerns. Using survey data, this paper analyses the key factors affecting the adoption of voluntary quality standards in the wine industry and the existence of a relationship between the adoption of voluntary quality standards and economic performance, measured in terms of labour productivity and marketing behaviour. The survey involved 89 cellars, of which 68 were non-certified and 21 had one or more food quality certifications. Using the data collected, an index based on Euclidean distances was constructed to compare economic performance between certified and non-certified firms. The findings provide evidence that internal motivations drive entrepreneurs to adopt voluntary standards and that wineries adopting voluntary standards exhibit better economic performance than non-certified wine firms. From a managerial viewpoint, these results suggest that although the adoption of voluntary quality certifications does not have a direct effect in terms of a labour productivity increase, it entails a business management improvement. For policymakers, the results suggest a need to develop policies and establish more stable financial assistance for the internationalisation of wine firms, thereby supporting them through this transition.

AB The food supply chain is a current focus for considerations of food safety and environmental impacts. The objective of this study was to investigate local food supply chain characteristics and develop a coordinated distribution system to improve logistics efficiency, reduce environmental impact, increase potential market for local food producers and improve traceability of food origin for consumers. The study was based on data from 90 local food producers and 19 existing large scale food distribution centres (LSFDC) from all over Sweden.
   Location analysis was done using Geographic Information System (GIS) to map locations of producers and LSFDCs; to build cluster of producers; and to determine optimal product collection centres (CC). The route analysis was carried out using Route LogiX software, firstly for collection of food products from farms to CCs based on two scenarios, either producers transporting their products (no coordination) or CCs managing coordinated collection of products, and secondly for product distribution from CCs to potential markets. When compared to the first scenario, the second had improved the number of routes, driving distance and product delivery time by 68%, 50% and 47% respectively. In total, 14 clusters of producers were formed and 86% of these clusters could be integrated into the LSFDCs. This network integration could make positive improvements towards potential markets, logistics efficiency, environmental issues and traceability of food quality. (C) 2011 IAgrE.

AB Chinese wolfberry or goji berry (Lycium barbarum) is an important traditional Chinese medicine. Its price and function has a close correlation with its geographical provenance. Illegal mislabeling motivated by commercial gains brings serious food safety problems and damages consumer confidence. In this work, a novel analytical strategy combined with chemometrics statistic tools was developed to determine the geographical origin of wolfberries from different provinces in China. Stable carbon isotopic ratios (delta C-13) of wolfberry volatile compounds (i.e. limonene, tetramethylpyrazine, safranal, geranylacetone, and beta-ionone) were determined by gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-IRMS) with headspace-solid phase micro extraction (HS-SPME). Five types of SPME fiber (Le. DVB/CAR/PDMS, CAR/PDMS, PDMS/DVB + OC, PDMS, and PA), extraction time, temperature and GC-IRMS conditions were comprehensively optimized to obtain the best adsorption of volatile compounds in wolfberry. Method integrity was assessed by comparing volatiles extracted using HS-SPME GC-IRMS with direct injection GC-IRMS and were in good agreement with each other. The geographical variations of volatile compounds using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were explored for individual delta C-13 values in wolfberry samples from Gansu, Ningxia and Qinghai. Geographical origin of wolfberry was differentiated by linear discrimination analysis (LDA), with an accuracy of 89.16%, 87.77% and 85.87% for these three provinces, respectively. These results showed the combination of SPME and IRMS provides a rapid and valid method to determine the geographical origin of wolfberry.

ID RAW WOOL; MANAGEMENT; SHEEP
AB Sustainable rural development depends on a multidimensional process based on the interaction of the economic, cultural, social, environmental, and political subsystems. Many studies have ascribed the extensive livestock systems a potential role in sustainable rural development. Sheep farming in Europe involves meat or dairy breeds that produce coarse wool unsuitable for textile use. Coarse wool has been historically used for mattresses or pillows; nowadays, it is a farm waste. The aim of this study was to suggest a methodology for the localization of wool collecting centers within a study area, i.e., the Sicily Region, in order to valorize a livestock waste, i.e., sheep wool. This methodology is based on a detailed database of the local livestock population and GIS usage. Moreover, this method could be replicable in the whole EU territory, where the EC regulation n. 21/2004 has established that each Member State set up a system for the identification and registration of ovine animals, for traceability veterinary reasons. On the basis of the number of animals shorn on a municipal basis, and the existing main roads, the most suitable areas for the localization of four wool collection centers have been identified. Furthermore, it was also hypothesized that each collecting center could be specialized in a specific treatment for subsequent wool use (e.g., amendment fertilizers, keratin extraction, green building material or geo-textile production).

AB The increasing concern regarding energy supply and the consequent rapid growth of the pellet market lead to the need to classify the product quality. To this aim, chemical-physical parameters and qualitative attributes are defined by the technical standards EN ISO 17,225 to classify the quality of biofuels, but, while the former can be determined by traditional chemical analysis, no methodologies have been set for the latter one. Hence, near-infrared spectroscopy was tested to obtain information about the origin and the source of the pellet, at the moment only declared by the producers and difficult to be achieved by conventional analysis. In fact, the great strength of the technique is based on the fact that biomass features could be read simultaneously with a rapid and cheap NIR measurement. Checking the presence of treated wood (e.g. residues from wood processing industry) especially in densified products, such as pellets and briquettes, is particular important since in several European countries, e.g. Italy, these materials are considered as waste. In this study more than a hundred samples of virgin and treated wood (residues from wood processing industries) were analysed by means of FT-NIR. Partial Least Square regression - Discriminant Analysis was used in order to classify samples between the two classes and different variables selection methods were tested in order to improve the classification performance of the models. The results obtained demonstrated that near infrared analysis coupled with multivariate analysis can be used in screening applications to classify virgin wood from glue-laminated wood and treated wood. In particular, the model for the discrimination of treated wood (except glue-laminated samples) from virgin wood performs 100% correct classification and the model for the discrimination between virgin wood and glue-laminated wood only has a 3.6% misclassification rate. The methodology can be considered as the first one able to provide information about the origin of the biomass in a rapid and cheap way.

AB The aim of this study was to develop a DNA barcode assay to authenticate the botanical origin of herbal teas. To reach this aim, we tested the efficiency of a PCR-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-CE) approach on commercial herbal tea samples using two noncoding plastid barcodes, the trnL intron and the intergenic spacer between trnL and trnF. Barcode DNA length polymorphisms proved successful in authenticating the species origin of herbal teas. We verified the validity of our approach by sequencing species-specific barcode amplicons from herbal tea samples. Moreover, we displayed the utility of PCR-CE assays coupled with sequencing to identify the origin of undeclared plant material in herbal tea samples. The PCR-CE assays proposed in this work can be applied as routine tests for the verification of botanical origin in herbal teas and can be extended to authenticate all types of herbal foodstuffs.

AB A Quick Response Code (QR Code) aims to provide accurate and traceable information to consumers wanting to verify the quality of agri-food products. This study aimed to investigate the experiences and intentions of scanning QR Code in traditional markets and supermarkets. Furthermore, the types of egg information in the QR Code were explored to identify consumer interests when purchasing eggs. The empirical data were collected from 1112 valid responses throughout Taiwan from July to September, 2020. The Logit, Probit models, and the Bivariate Probit model were used to examine the data. Results showed that shoppers' propensity to scan QR Code revealed a significant difference between traditional markets and supermarkets, i.e., supermarket shoppers having higher a propensity to scan a QR Code. Of the 10 types of potential egg information in the QR Code, over half of respondents said that the production certificate label and inspection information were the top reasons that they would be interested in scanning a QR Code. This was particularly the case for homemakers aged between 51 and 60 years old and those who had scanned QR Code before and would like to pursue more egg information. Since the egg producers have resisted joining the traceability system, the implication of this study provides very practical strategies for government, policy makers, and producers in Taiwan.

AB China has experienced a series of high-profile food safety scandals in the past few years that seriously challenged public confidence in the domestic food industry. Much attention has been paid to Chinese government's food regulatory and inspection systems. Scant research, however, has been devoted to analyzing Chinese consumers' food safety concerns. This study interviewed 2092 Chinese consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Jinan, and Harbin and used the Conditional Logit model, Mixed Logit model, and the Latent Class model to analyze consumer preferences and marginal willingness to pay (WTP) for selected food safety attributes of Fuji apple products. We identified three consumer segments: certification-oriented (65.9%), price and origin-oriented (19.1%), and not interested (15.0%). Results reveal that Chinese consumers, in general, are willing to pay a premium for selected food safety attributes. Consumers' perceptual and attitudinal factors and socio-demographic characteristics are used to determine the sources of preference heterogeneity. Marginal analysis is also conducted to estimate the response of the model and selectione'd probability to potential policy levels, such as increasing the perception of food safety and the trust on labeling and traceability information to improve the evaluation of food safety.

AB A novel purity certified reference material (CRM) of clorprenaline (GBW 09255) was first development using the mass balance method, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (QNMR). The candidate sample preparation, homogeneity test, long-term and short-term stability studies, characterization and uncertainty evaluation were investigated in this study. For characterization of the CRM, the main parameters affecting the accuracy of the measurement method were systematically explored. Under the optimum conditions, the certified value of clorprenaline is 99.6% with an extended uncertainty of 0.4% (k = 2). The developed CRM was sufficiently homogeneous between and within bottles and stable for at least one year at-18 ?C and 9 days at 60 ?C. The uncertainty was evaluated by combing the contributions from characterization, homogeneity and stability. The developed clorprenaline CRM would be effectively support for the method validation, proficiency testing, nationwide quality and safety monitoring and the traceability of measurement results in livestock samples.

AB Animal health and welfare together with technical aspects relating to the REID based electronic identification (EID) of a total of 114,857 small ruminants, reared in 268 semi-extensive farms, were assessed in Sarda ewes, Sarda and Sarda x Maltese goats, over a period of six years (2006-2011). A multi-purpose investigation was carried out to: (1) monitor the effects on the health and welfare of electronically identified (EID) sheep and goats in farms; (2) support technicians and veterinary practitioners, during fieldwork (decision making) should problems arise relating to EID small ruminants, on a large scale. A coded manual of operations for EID problem solving was drawn up to support an experimental help desk service (HDS). The HDS relied on the technological breakthrough due to the improvement of radiological analysis (digital X-ray): such technology was used to check the performance of the REID bolus (composed of a RFID device: transponder, and a ceramic case) directly on farms, in relation to its retention and the functioning of the transponder (carrier of the electronic individual code, EIC) in the animal body. The occurrences of administration accidents of the bolus were recorded; undetectable EICs in relation to the different types of devices deployed were listed as: loss, breakage, malfunctioning, doubled code/device fraud. The ceramic boluses currently in use were seen to vary considerably in terms of dimensions (length and width) and mass, as follows (in descending order): 70 mm x 21 mm, 72 g; 70 mm x 18 mm, 70 g; 66 mm x 18 mm, 50 g; 58 mm x 12 mm, 20 g. All kinds of ceramic bolus held an inner transponder (32.5 mm x 3.8 mm, 134.2 kHz), according to ISO standard 11784. Digital X-ray in the field was a useful tool to assess the localization of the transponder/bolus or both in the animals' body, after ectopic detection or un-detection of the transponder's EIC. Accidents in bolus administration took place in 0.093% of cases, ranging in severity from mild (0.075%: bolus stopped in the oro-pharynx or in the naso-pharynx, X-ray checks are useful in the latter occurrence) to lethal (0.011%: bolus in trachea; 0.007%: oesophageal rupture, found at necropsy). A significant (p < 0.001) loss rate (0.369%) involved both sheep and goats identified by means of a 20 g bolus, whereas the loss rate strongly decreased when 70 g (0.005%) or 72 g (0.002%) bolus was used, observed significantly in goats (p < 0.05).

AB BACKGROUND: Freezing represents a common conservation practice regarding vegetal foodstuffs. Since compositional features need to be monitored during storage, the development of rapid monitoring tools suitable for assessing nutritional characteristics arises as a pertinent issue. In this study, cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) pods, both fresh and after 6 and 9 months of freezing at -18 degrees C, were evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography for their content of protein as well as of essential and nonessential amino acids, while their Fourier transform infrared spectra in the mid infrared (MIR) and near infrared (NIR) ranges were concomitantly registered to assess the feasibility of this approach for the traceability of these frozen matrices.
   RESULTS: For the NIR interval, the application of the 1st derivative to the spectral data retrieved the best results, while for lower concentrations the application of the Savitzky-Golay algorithm was indispensable to achieve quantification models for the amino acids. MIR is also suitable for this purpose, though being unable to quantify amino acids with concentrations below 0.07 mmol g(-1) dry weight, irrespective of the data treatment used.
   CONCLUSIONS: The spectroscopic approach constitutes a methodology suitable for monitoring the impact of freezing on the nutritional properties of cowpea pods, allowing accurate quantification of the protein and amino acid contents, while NIR displayed better performance.

DE Condiment; spectroscopy; safety; authenticity; chemometrics
AB Condiments are the magical ingredients that make the food present a richer taste. In recent years, due to the increasing consciousness of food safety and human health, much progress has been made in developing rapid and nondestructive techniques for the evaluation of food condiments safety, authentication, and traceability. The potential of spectroscopy techniques, such as near-infrared (NIR), mid-infrared (MIR), Raman, fluorescence, inductively coupled plasma (ICP), and hyperspectral imaging techniques, has been widely enhanced by numerous applications in this field because of their advantages over other analytical techniques. Following a brief introduction of condiment and safety basics, this review mainly focuses on recent vibrational and atomic spectral applications for condiment nondestructive analysis and evaluation, including (1) chemical hazards detection; (2) microbiological hazards detection; and (3) authenticity concerns. The review shows current spectroscopies to be effective tools that will play indispensable roles for food condiment evaluation. In addition, online/real-time applications of these techniques promise to be a huge growth field in the near future.

AB The resistance of Listeria monocytogenes biofilms formed under food processing conditions, against various sanitizing agents and disinfection procedures was evaluated in the present study. The first sanitation procedure included biofilm formation on stainless steel coupons (SS) placed in tryptic soy broth supplemented with 0.6% yeast extract (TSBYE) of various concentrations of NaCl (0.5, 7.5 and 9.5%) at different temperatures (5 and 20 degrees C). The biofilms formed were exposed to warm (60 degrees C) water for 20 min, or to peroxyacetic acid (2% PAA) for 1, 2, 3 and 6 min. Treatment with warm water caused no significant (P >= 0.05) reductions in the attached populations. Conversely, surviving bacteria on SS coupons decreased as the exposure time to 2% PAA increased and could not be detected by culture after 6 min of exposure. Biofilms formed at 20 degrees C were more resistant to PAA than biofilms formed at 5 degrees C. Salt concentration in the growth medium had no marked impact on the resistance to PM. The second sanitation procedure included biofilm formation of nonadapted (NA) and acid-adapted (AA) cells in TSBYE of pH 5.0 and 7.0 (i.e., NA-5.0, NA-7.0 and AA-5.0, AA-7.0) at 4 degrees C. Coupons bearing attached cells of L monocytogenes were periodically exposed to chlorine (0.465% Cl-), quaternary ammonium compound (1% QAC) and 2% PM. The resistance of attached cells to QAC, PM and Cl- followed the order: AA-5.0>NA-7.0 >= AA-7.0>NA-5.0. The most effective sanitizer was QAC followed by PM and Cl-. The results can lead to the development of efficient sanitation strategies in order to eliminate L. monocytogenes from the processing environment. Furthermore, such results may explain the presence of L. monocytogenes after sanitation as a result of cell attachment history. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB RATIONALE: No study has investigated the variations in stable isotope ratios (SIRs) of bioelements within a Protected Designations of Origin (PDO) cheese and few studies have focused on the dietary background of animals. For traceability purposes, it is important to know how and whether these issues affect SIRs in a PDO cheese.
   METHODS: Thirty-six Pecorino Siciliano cheese samples were collected in three east-Sicilian areas in seasons in which green herbage was present or absent in the diet of the animals. The determination of C, N and S SIRs was performed using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer coupled with an elemental analyser. The Hand O SIRs were measured using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer equipped with a thermal conversion elemental analyser pyrolysis unit.
   RESULTS: The C, N, H, O and S SIRs measured in defatted cheeses were subjected to a multivariate stepwise discriminant analysis to verify if cheeses could be distinguished based on their geographical origin and on the animals' feeding regimen. Sulfur and nitrogen SIRs allowed the best discrimination among the three areas (97.2% correct classification of the cheeses). The discrimination of the feeding system, to check the presence or not of fresh forage in the diet of the animals, correctly classified 86.1% of the cheeses. The C and O SIRs were the most effective parameters.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the variability in C, H, O, N and S SIRs can allow discrimination between cheeses produced in a narrow geographical region within a PDO area. This may lead to the search for new tools in authentication studies such as the creation of specific isoscapes. Moreover, this study confirms that SIR determination can also discriminate cheeses obtained from animals fed in stalls from those produced when animals have access to green forage, with benefit in terms of environmental impact, animal welfare and product quality.

AB The market demand for fresh sweet cherries in China has experienced continuous growth due to its rich nutritional value and unique taste. Nonetheless, the characteristics of fruits, transportation conditions and uneven distribution pose a huge obstacle in keeping high quality, especially in express logistics. This paper proposes dynamic monitoring and quality assessment system (DMQAS) to reduce the quality loss of sweet cherries in express logistics. The DMQAS was tested and evaluated in three typical express logistics scenarios with "Meizao" sweet cherries. The results showed that DMQAS could monitor the changes of critical micro-environmental parameters (temperature, relative humidity, O-2, CO2 and C2H4) during the express logistics, and the freshness prediction model showed high accuracy (the relative error was controlled within 10%). The proposed DMQAS could provide complete and accurate microenvironment data and can be used to further improve the quality and safety management of sweet cherries during express logistics.

AB We have developed the MC64-ClustalWP2 as a new implementation of the Clustal W algorithm, integrating a novel parallelization strategy and significantly increasing the performance when aligning long sequences in architectures with many cores. It must be stressed that in such a process, the detailed analysis of both the software and hardware features and peculiarities is of paramount importance to reveal key points to exploit and optimize the full potential of parallelism in many-core CPU systems. The new parallelization approach has focused into the most time-consuming stages of this algorithm. In particular, the so-called progressive alignment has drastically improved the performance, due to a fine-grained approach where the forward and backward loops were unrolled and parallelized. Another key approach has been the implementation of the new algorithm in a hybrid-computing system, integrating both an Intel Xeon multi-core CPU and a Tilera Tile64 many-core card. A comparison with other Clustal W implementations reveals the high-performance of the new algorithm and strategy in many-core CPU architectures, in a scenario where the sequences to align are relatively long (more than 10 kb) and, hence, a many-core GPU hardware cannot be used. Thus, the MC64-ClustalWP2 runs multiple alignments more than 18x than the original Clustal W algorithm, and more than 7x than the best x86 parallel implementation to date, being publicly available through a web service. Besides, these developments have been deployed in cost-effective personal computers and should be useful for life-science researchers, including the identification of identities and differences for mutation/polymorphism analyses, biodiversity and evolutionary studies and for the development of molecular markers for paternity testing, germplasm management and protection, to assist breeding, illegal traffic control, fraud prevention and for the protection of the intellectual property (identification/traceability), including the protected designation of origin, among other applications.

AB Due to the existence of Lingzhi adulteration, there is a growing demand for species classification of medicinal mushrooms by various techniques. The objective of this study was to explore a rapid and reliable way to distinguish between different Lingzhi species and compare the influence of data pretreatment methods on the recognition results. To this end, 120 fresh fruiting bodies of Lingzhi were collected, and all of them were analyzed by attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). Random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) classification models were established for raw and pretreated second derivative (SD) spectral matrices to authenticate different Lingzhi species. The results of multivariate statistical analysis indicated that the SD preprocessing method displayed a higher classification ability, which may be attributed to the analysis of powder samples that requires removal of overlapping peaks and baseline shifts. Compared with RF, the results of the SVM and PLS-DA methods were more satisfying, and their accuracies for the test set were both 100%. Among SVM and PLS-DA, the training set and test set accuracy of PLS-DA were both 100%. In conclusion, ATR-FTIR spectroscopy data pretreated by SD combined with PLS-DA is a simple, rapid, non-destructive and relatively inexpensive method to discriminate between mushroom species and provide a good reference to quality assessment.

AB A traceable declaration of health is now necessary for many plants, especially those being monitored for disease such as certified nursery stock. Radio-frequency identification (RFID) microchips placed in woody plants can be used to store and retrieve information on their health status through all phases of propagation and in the field. The microchip is linked to a database in which many other kinds of information, such as pesticide applications, can be collected and linked. Using a Web-based platform, information can be shared globally and accessed quickly. RFID technology can also be integrated with cell phones and netbooks for the easy recording of images and audio, which can be linked back to the chip and shared - or, with global positioning systems (GPS), used to create a virtual orchard or vineyard. There are myriad uses for this new technology, which is expanding rapidly and has been implemented successfully in the European livestock industry. Trials have shown its particular relevance to plant pathology, where it could be an important risk management tool.

AB The morel mushroom (Morchella sp.) is reputed as one of the most highly-prized edible fungi with mounting cultivated area as well as commercial popularity in China. To date, optimized methods specific for quality evaluation and constituent analysis of Morchella sp. are still non-available, impeding the healthy and sustainable development of this industry. Herein, an untargeted UPLC-Q-TOF-MS-based metabolomics approach was performed to characterize the metabolite profiles of morel samples from four distinct geographical origins of China, viz. Gansu, Guizhou, Liaoning, and Henan province. A total of 32 significantly different metabolites assigned to lipids (19), organic acids (9), amino acids (3), and ketones (1) were identified to distinguish the geographic-segregation samples amenable to multivariate analysis. These metabolites may serve as molecular markers indicative of specific regions. More importantly, the lipid, protein and amino acid metabolism were responsible for geographic differences as revealed by KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Collectively, this study not only pioneered high-throughput methodology to evaluate quality of Morchella sp. and distinguish geographical origins in a sensitive, rapid and efficient manner, but also shed light on the potential link between physiochemical variation and geological origins from a metabolic perspective, which may be conducive to the advancement of edible fungi industry and establishment of food traceability system.

AB Food nanotechnology is a relatively recent area which has opened up a whole universe of new applications in food industry. Some of these applications include; improved taste, flavor, color, texture and consistency of foodstuffs, increased absorption and bioavailability of nutraceuticals and health supplements, development of food antimicrobials, new food packaging materials with improved mechanical barrier and antimicrobial properties, nanosensors for traceability and monitoring the condition of food during transport and storage, encapsulation of food components or additives. Smart delivery of nutrients, bioseparation of proteins, rapid sampling of biological and chemical contaminants and nanoencapsulation of nutraceuticals are few more emerging areas of nanotechnology for food industry. Nanotechnology holds great promise to provide benefits not just within food products but also around food products. There is an urgent need for regulatory systems capable of managing any risks associated with nanofoods and the use of nanotechnology in food industry. In this review, applications of nanotechnology in functional food with special attention to related regulatory issues are discussed.

AB Higher accuracy for a prediction model is the unremitting pursuit in the field of optics nondestructive technology. The multipoint full-transmittance spectra ranging from 650 to 1000 nm were acquired at a speed of 0.5 m/s using an on-line spectrum measurement system. The combination of mean normalization and 11 points smoothing were selected as the best spectral preprocessing method for removing undesirable signal excursion and light scatters existed in the original spectra. By investigating the interference of transmittance spectral intensity on the prediction accuracy with the method of efficient spectrum optimization proposed in our study, we found that those transmittance spectra with intensity lower than 0.4 at 920 nm were inefficient for SSC prediction. Furthermore, three different variable selection algorithms were used to select characteristic band for further optimizing the prediction model, the best prediction model was built based on 45 variables selected by random flog (RF) and the performance of the best model was R-pre = 0.9043 and RMSEP = 0.4787 respectively. All mentioned above illustrated that efficient spectrum optimization method coupled with variable selection algorithms were useful for improving the accuracy and robust of prediction model.

AB The pellet energy market is expanding rapidly in Europe and also at the global level, in response to the continuously growing energy demand and because of the high degree of reliability, the easy handling, and the cheap and simple logistics, in comparison to other solid biomasses. The fast growth of this market has highlighted the problem of product quality, which has strong repercussions for technical, environmental, and economic aspects. The biomass quality is defined by several chemical physical parameters that are directly measurable in the laboratory. In addition, there are quality attributes related to origin and source, difficult to investigate through traditional analyses, such as the type of wood (hardwood/softwood) and the presence of bark. The development of a rapid technique able to provide this information could be an advantageous tool for the energy sector proving indications on biofuel traceability and sustainability. More than 90 samples belonging to three of the most common European species for the energy pellet sector (fir, pine, and beech) have been collected and analyzed by means of Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) coupled with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The results show that the main variation in the data is due to both differences between bark and wood, as well as differences between hardwood and softwood. The differences are mainly linked to changes in composition and amounts of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and extractives. Moreover, 30 wood/bark blends (2%-20% (w/w)) were analyzed, indicating the ability of the system to recognize blends from pure material. This study has shown that spectroscopy coupled with multivariate data analysis is a useful tool verifying the compliance of producer declarations and assisting experts in evaluation of the biomass quality.

AB A new matrix certified reference material (CRM) of florfenicol in prawn meat powder [GBW(E)100638] was developed for validation of analytical method and assurance of measurement quality in the routine monitoring of prawn food safety. The incurred prawn materials were freeze-dried, ground, sieved, homogenized, bottled and gamma-irradiated to prepare the CRM candidates. For characterization of the CRM, isotope dilution coupled with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry as a reliable and accurate method was studied and employed by all participants in co-laboratory value assignment program. The certified value with expanded uncertainty (k = 2, at a confidence of 95%) was 11.8 mu g/kg +/- 1.9 mu g/kg for florfenicol in prawn meat powder. Homogeneity, long-term stability of fifteen months at -20 degrees C for storage, and short-term stability of nine days at 4 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 40 degrees C for transportation and use were examined. In addition, uncertainties originating from characterization, inhomogeneity and instability were assessed.

AB Species-specific PCR-ELISA assays for the identification of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), Alaska pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus), and ling (Molva molva) in food products have been developed. The method, comprising a set of primers common to the first two species, a set of primers for M. molva, and a probe for each species, was designed using ND4 and cytochrome b genes as molecular markers. The sensitivity and selectivity were then determined for each assay. These assays were afterward used to analyze DNA extracted from commercial fish products. The presence of the target species was successfully detected in all analyzed samples, demonstrating the applicability of this method to the analysis of food products.

AB The amount and composition of the phenolic components play a major role in determining the quality of olive oil. The traditional liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) method requires a time-consuming sample preparation to obtain the "phenolic profile" of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). This study aimed to develop a microdialysis extraction (MDE) as an alternative to the LLE method to evaluate the phenolic components of EVOO. 'To this purpose, a microdialysis device and dialysis procedure were developed. "Dynamic-oil" microdialysis was performed using an extracting solution (80:20 methanol/ water) flow rate of 2 mu L min(-1) and a constant EVOO stream of 4 mu L min(-1). The results indicated a strong positive correlation between MDE and the LLE method, providing a very similar phenolic profile obtained with traditional LLE. In conclusion, the MDE approach, easier and quicker in comparison to LLE, provided a reliable procedure to determine the phenolic components used as a marker of the quality and traceability of EVOO.

AB In the last few years considerable interest is growing for high food quality, both for organoleptic and nutritional aspects. As for tomatoes, the yellow fruit varieties are conquering the consumer markets in many Mediterranean countries. Among the great variability of yellow tomatoes, one landrace of "Pomodorino giallo del Vesuvio", named GiaGiu (E40), differs from the traditional "Pomodorino del Piennolo" for the fruit color and stands out for its quality traits, such as high glutamic acid, pectin content and titratable acidity of fruit, thus increasing its demand for both fresh consumption and cooking purposes. The aim of this work was to phenotypically and genotypically distinguish the GiaGiu landrace through morphological descriptors and molecular markers, in order to provide an effective tool to authenticate this product as fresh and processed tomatoes. Morphological characterization evidenced that the distinctive traits of GiaGiu landrace were the potato leaf morphology and the pyriform shape with a pointed apex of the yellow fruits. The genotypic distinction of E40 was performed by using two Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequence (CAPS) markers designed on a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) of the Phytoene synthase 1 (psy1) gene that confers the yellow color to tomato fruit and already known as specific of GiaGiu genotype. Additional CAPS markers were designed on two private mutations of E40 genes derived from data retrieved from a Genotyping-By-Sequencing (GBS) dataset, already available. These findings were confirmed by comparing E40 private mutations with the 360 accessions of the BGI tomato 360 genomes rese-quencing project. The designed markers allowed to distinguish GiaGiu genotype in all fresh and processed fruit tomato matrices, thus representing a molecular tool able to prevent food fraud and authenticate GiaGiu products.

AB African swine fever virus (ASFV) is the pathogen of African swine fever, a highly contagious and fatal disease of wild boar and domestic pigs. The flow of ASFV through pork products is more concealed, higher risky, and more difficult to prevent and control. Presently, on-site ASFV detection methods in preclinical infected pigs and circulated pork products are lacking. Here, fluorescent test strip-based rapid ASFV detection method in pork was established combined with recombinase aided amplification (RAA) and quantum dot microspheres (QDMs). This method is specific to ASFV with no cross-reactivity to pseudorabies virus (PRV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). The method also showed highly sensitivity with a detection limit of 1 copy for ASFV plasmid templates containing B646L gene and 100 copies/g for DNA extracts from clinical pork samples within a short detection time of less than 25 min. Additionally, the method showed 99.17% consistency with real-time PCR in the ASFV detection of 120 clinical pork samples. Overall, the QDMs-based test strip method provides specific, sensitive, rapid, and simple detection of ASFV in pork, which may contribute to maintain the food safety of pork products, and facilitate ASFV traceability and prevention.

AB In this work, a novel dual signal amplification strategy for aptasensor employing reduced graphene with silver nanoparticles and prussian blue-gold nanocomposites was developed for detection of acetamiprid. To improve the sensitivity of aptasensors, reduced graphene oxide-silver nanopartides (rGo-AgNPs) were modified on a bare glassy carbon electrode surface, which provided a large specific surface area for subsequent material immobilization and amplified current signal. The electrical signal output and sensitivity of the aptasensor was significantly improved after the immobilization of prussian blue-gold nanopartides (PB-AuNPs) as a catalyst for the redox reaction. The analysis experiment exhibited that it had super-high sensitivity with a detection limit of 0.30 pM (S/N = 3), which met the requirements of the vast majority of daily leaf vegetable testing. Under optimized conditions, the proposed aptasensor showed a wide linear detection range from 1 pM to 1 mu M. This aptasensor also had good stability and high selectivity for acetamiprid detection without an interfering effect of some other pesticides. The proposed aptasensor displayed good recovery rates in real samples, which proposed a new method for constructing electrochemical sensors and provided a novel tool for rapid, sensitive analysis of pesticides with low cost.

ID SYSTEMS; INTEROPERABILITY; KNOWLEDGE
AB This paper presents an ontological approach of scientific experimental data integration across complementary sub-domains, i.e., agricultural production and food processing, with an application to viticulture and winemaking. The two main steps in this approach are (i) to integrate preexisting ontologies to create a so-called ontology network and (ii) to populate the ontology network with experimental data from various sources. The Agri-Food Experiment Ontology (AFEO), a new ontology network, was developed, based on two ontological resources, i.e., AEO (Ontology for Agricultural Experiments) and OFPE (Ontology for Food Processing Experiments). It contains 136 concepts which cover various viticulture practices, as well as winemaking products and operations. AFEO was used to guide the data integration of two different data sources, i.e., viticulture experimental data stored in a relational database, and winemaking experimental data stored in Microsoft Excel files. Two applications illustrate the approach. The first one is on wine traceability and the second one is related to the influence of irrigation practices and winemaking methods on GSH concentration in wine. These examples show that data integration guided by an ontology network can provide researchers with the information necessary to address extended research questions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

   produce; Good agricultural practice (GAP)
ID FOOD QUALITY; SUPPLY-CHAIN; TRACEABILITY; SAFETY; MARKETS; TRUST
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the factors hindering the adoption of good agricultural practices (GAPs) in the Thai fresh fruit and vegetable industry from the perspectives of key stakeholders in different tiers of the supply chain up to consumers.
   Design/methodology/approach - Semi-structured interviews were carried out in Bangkok and nearby cities. The key informants were experts, governmental authorities, producers, distributors, exporters, and consumers. A qualitative content-summarising approach was used to analyse the interview transcripts.
   Findings - Stakeholders perceived the credibility of national GAP (Q-GAP) standards implemented in the Thai domestic market as low, due to a lack of reliable verification and traceability and because the system is managed by governmental bodies. Consumer demand could drive the market of safe produce, but retail stores are the main influencers of producers' adoption of GAPs in domestic markets.
   Research limitations/implications - The findings are based on a small group of Thai fresh produce industry players and consumers who operate mainly in an urban context.
   Practical implications - The paper provides relevant information for policy makers and industrialists to find appropriate strategies to sustain GAPs in Thailand. Stakeholder awareness of food safety issues and information provision are crucial.
   Originality/value - This is the first in-depth study of stakeholders' perceptions of GAP implementation in the Thai fresh produce supply chain as the industry is currently transitioning from a commodity market to a quality/safety-oriented market. The results raise important issues regarding GAP adoption, food safety certification, and labelling in Thailand.

   TRACEABILITY
AB BACKGROUND: Trace element fingerprinting has been widely used for identification of provenance of regional food. In the case of products from conventional agriculture, it is expected that the elemental composition will comply with that of the commercially available substrate of the plants. Therefore, for products without a direct relationship with the regional soil the region-specific differences in elemental composition are no longer recognizable. The idea of this work is the labeling of tomatoes with rare earth elements (REE) in the ultra-trace range for food authentication.
   RESULTS: Labeling of tomatoes was carried out either by watering the soil with Nd- and Er-spiked water or by adding these elements as solid oxides to the soil. In both cases enrichment of Nd and Er relative to the control group was detected in tomato fruits and leaves using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Tomato plants rapidly absorb the dissolved REE from the irrigation water, and watering for a short period just before ripeness is sufficient to induce REE labels.
   CONCLUSION: Labeling with trace amounts of REE could potentially be used to assure the provenance of tomatoes of local origin and separate these from products of foreign origin.

AB In this study the labelling compliance of 40 caviar products collected from a major Chinese Business to Customer online platform was assessed. The label information was analyzed according to the requirements of the Chinese standard for prepackaged food and of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) Resolution on Conservation and trade in sturgeons and paddlefish. A molecular analysis based on DNA barcoding targeting two mitochondrial genes (COI and cytb) was used to support the label assessment. All products were fully compliant to the national labelling standard, and they were verified as belonging to Chinese producing plants. On the contrary, CITES requirements were never satisfied and no reference to the production method (wild catch or aquaculture) and to the origin of the roes processed for caviar production was reported. The sturgeon species or hybrid were declared in 32.5% of the products. Despite the limits in discriminating among Acipenser spp. and commercial hybrids, the molecular analysis was confirmed as an effective screening tool to monitor products authenticity. The molecular analysis highlighted no counterfeiting with heterologous species, being all the products confirmed as sturgeon species. However, 42.5% of the products did not fully match their label information. Evidences from the study stressed the need to fill an evident gap in the traceability of caviar products by promoting the use of CITES labelling to ensure products fair trade and sustainability, as well as consumers protection.

ID FEEDING-BEHAVIOR; ANIMALS; POSTURE; IMAGES; SYSTEM
AB The evolution of agriculture towards intensive farming leads to an increasing demand for animal identification associated with high traceability, driven by the need for quality control and welfare management in agricultural animals. Automatic identification of individual animals is an important step to achieve individualised care in terms of disease detection and control, and improvement of the food quality. For example, as feeding patterns can differ amongst pigs in the same pen, even in homogenous groups, automatic registration shows the most potential when applied to an individual pig. In the EU for instance, this capability is required for certification purposes. Although the RFID technology has been gradually developed and widely applied for this task, chip implanting might still be time-consuming and costly for current practical applications. In this paper, a novel framework composed of computer vision algorithms, machine learning and deep learning techniques is proposed to offer a relatively low-cost and scalable solution of pig recognition. Firstly, pig faces and eyes are detected automatically by two Haar feature-based cascade classifiers and one shallow convolutional neural network to extra high-quality images. Secondly, face recognition is performed by employing a deep convolutional neural network. Additionally, class activation maps generated by grad-CAM and saliency maps are utilised to visually understand how the discriminating parameters have been learned by the neural network. By applying the proposed approach on 10 randomly selected pigs filmed in farm condition, the proposed method demonstrates the superior performance against the state-of-art method with an accuracy of 83% over 320 testing images. The outcome of this study will facilitate the real-application of AI-based animal identification in swine production.

AB The lipids in goat milk from Guangdong Province (GGM), Shaanxi Province (SGM), and Inner Mongolia Province (NGM) were analyzed and compared using untargeted lipidomics. A total of 16 lipid sub-classes and 638 lipid molecules were identified in the three groups. The main lipids were diacylglycerol (DG), triacylglycerol (TG), and glycerophosphatidylethanolamine (PE). The contents of glycerophosphatidylcholine (PC), PE, glycerophosphatidylinositol (PI), sphingomyelin (SM), glucosylceramide (GlcCer), lactosylceramide (LacCer), DG, and TG were significantly different (P < 0.05) in three groups. Moreover, 173 significantly different lipids were screened out, and 13 lipid molecules could be applied as potential lipid markers for identifying the geographic region of goat milk. In addition, the related metabolic pathways were also analyzed. A hypothetical scheme was drawn by linking the most relevant metabolic pathways. This work will provide basics for the establishment of the Saanen goat milk traceability system and provide comprehensive lipid information for the goat milk of different regions.

AB Mycoplasma synoviae is a common pathogen affecting poultry and has important economic significance. Infectious synovitis is the most common clinical effect. Since 2010, the incidence of M. synoviae infection in China has rapidly risen, causing significant economic losses to the chicken industry; however, the cause of the disease outbreak remains unclear. Phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses of field strains will help unravel the mystery. The multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) method is typically utilized to conduct genotyping and traceability analysis of microorganisms. MLST of M. synoviae has previously been established and shown strong discriminatory power. In this study, 54 Chinese M. synoviae strains isolated from 2016 to 2020 were genotyped by MLST based on seven housekeeping genes. This study aimed to investigate the dominant genotypes of M. synoviae in China and reveal the genetic and evolutionary relationships of these isolates. All 54 isolates were found to have new allelic sequences, which may indicate new sequence types. The results of BURST analysis indicated that all 54 strains belonged to group 11, which is an independent phylogenetic branch, and were separated from any other reference strains (189 isolates) in the PubMLST database. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that the M. synoviae strains circulating in China are relatively independent in terms of transmission and evolutionary relationships.

AB The European Culture Collections' Organisation presents two new model documents for Material Deposit Agreement (MDA) and Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) designed to enable microbial culture collection leaders to draft appropriate agreement documents for, respectively, deposit and supply of materials from a public collection. These tools provide guidance to collections seeking to draft an MDA and MTA, and are available in open access to be used, modified, and shared. The MDA model consists of a set of core fields typically included in a 'deposit form' to collect relevant information to facilitate assessment of the status of the material under access and benefit sharing (ABS) legislation. It also includes a set of exemplary clauses to be included in 'terms and conditions of use' for culture collection management and third parties. The MTA model addresses key issues including intellectual property rights, quality, safety, security and traceability. Reference is made to other important tools such as best practices and code of conduct related to ABS issues. Besides public collections, the MDA and MTA model documents can also be useful for individual researchers and microbial laboratories that collect or receive microbial cultures, keep a working collection, and wish to share their material with others.

AB Traceability of dairy products is an important issue for the dairy industry. Empirical studies have demonstrated the utility of stable isotope measurements on milk for verification of origin. However, various drivers influence the isotopic composition of a food stuff, such as rainfall levels or food supplements. Relationships between the isotopic composition (delta H-2, delta O-18, delta C-13 and delta N-15) of milk fatty acids, the water component of the milk, and feed and farm water from 18 New Zealand dairy farms were studied. Significant relationships between the isotopic composition of milk and both farm water and feed fatty acids were observed. Measurement of both diet and drinking water from each dairy farm enabled the underlying environmental correlations to milk fatty acids to be explored by analysis of their respective delta H-2 values. Development of this technology may provide a diagnostic tool for determining type and the origin of dietary feed utilised in milk production. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Black pepper is one of the most consumed spices all over the world. Due to its high demand and nutritional value, a metabolomics approach based on GC-Orbitrap-HRMS fingerprinting and chemometrics was applied to assess its geographical traceability and processing authenticity. GC-HRMS-based fingerprints were obtained using a simple ultrasound-assisted extraction method, which may be easily implemented in routine activities of quality control. Unsupervised methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA), were performed for sample overview according to the investigated origins (Brazil, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka) and processing (sterilized vs nonsterilized samples). Further orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) models were validated by cross- and external validation, providing satisfactory performance for geographical and processing authentication, as well as excellent predictive ability for further samples. Furthermore, reliable putative identification of 12 key metabolites (markers) was performed, highlighting the feasibility of combining untargeted GC-HRMS analysis with chemometrics for quality control of black pepper.

AB Agri-food value chain is an area of significant importance because of providing sustainable, affordable, safety and sufficient food, feed, fibre and fuel to consumers, it is critical to ensure these value chains running smoothly and successfully by applying advanced internet technologies. Blockchain technology is a new digital technological approach underpinned by the Industry 4.0 to ensuring data integrity and preventing tampering and single point failure through offering fault-tolerance, immutability, trust, transparency and full traceability of the stored transaction records to all agri-food value chain partners. This paper used systematic literature network analysis to review the state-of-the-art blockchain technology including its recent advances, main applications in agri-food value chain and challenges from a holistic perspective. The findings suggest that blockchain technology together with advanced information and communication technology and internet of things have been adopted for the improvement of agri-food value chain management in four main aspects: traceability, information security, manufacturing and sustainable water management. Six challenges have been identified including storage capacity and scalability, privacy leakage, high cost and regulation problem, throughput and latency issue, and lack of skills. Based on the critical analysis of literature, research gaps and future research directions are proposed in this paper regarding the applications and challenges of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. This study makes contributions to the extant literature in the field of agri-food value chain management by discovering the potential of blockchain technology and its implications for agri-food value chain performance improvements such as food safety, food quality and food traceability.

AB 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based untargeted metabolomics has been extensively used for the geographical discrimination of food samples. In analyzing complex samples, this technique faces the challenges of baseline drift and NMR peak position shifts, resulting in inaccurate geographical discrimination by current chemometric models, like partial least squares. To address this problem, we provide a novel automatic untargeted chemometrics strategy named AntDAS-NMR in this work. AntDAS-NMR utilizes the originally acquired NMR spectra as inputs to automatically perform baseline drift correction, NMR peak detection, NMR peak-based spectrum alignment, and geographical discrimination analysis. The developed strategy is used for the geographical discrimination of Goji honey samples from the northwest zones of China. Results indicate that with the aid of AntDAS-NMR, the artifacts of baseline drifts and NMR peak shift that influence the geographical discrimination model can be reasonably resolved and that Goji honey samples from various provinces of China can be satisfactorily classified. Additionally, the performance of AntDAS-NMR is comparable with classic NMR data analysis tools, like COW, icoshift, PAFFT, and RAFFT. In conclusion, the AntDAS-NMR may be used as a candidate for 1H NMR-based untargeted metabolomics.

AB Food safety is a major public health issue worldwide, especially in heavily populated countries such as China. As in other countries, the predominant food safety issues in China are foodborne diseases caused by microbial pathogens. Hence, this review provides a systematic overview on microbial food safety in the past, present, and future in China. Management of microbial food safety in China is generally divided into three stages: Stage I before 2000, Stage II from 2000 to 2009, and Stage III from 2010 to present. At Stage I, China's main food concern gradually shifted from food security to food safety. At Stage II, foodborne pathogen surveillance was initiated and gradually became a focus of microbial food safety marked by the establishment of national food contamination monitoring system in 2000 and the promulgation of China Food Safety Law in 2009, although chemical food safety was considered a priority issue during this stage. At Stage III, microbial food safety was recognized as a high priority supported by many national food safety policies such as the launch of a national foodborne disease molecular tracing network in 2013 and the revision of China Food Safety Law in 2015. Advancement in food safety education and research support by central and local governments has also made significant contributions to tackling and solving microbial food safety problems. Management in the future should be focused on active involvement of food industries in mitigating microbial risks by introducing ISO 22000, regulatory enforcement to oversee compliances to standards and rules, and application of molecular tools for fast detection and source tracking to support decision-making. Future research efforts may include, but are not limited to, exploitation of interaction mechanisms among pathogenic bacteria, food and gut microbiota, smart traceability of microbial hazards, and development of novel antimicrobial strategies.

AB Macrohyporia cocos is a medicinal and edible fungi, which is consumed widely. The epidermis and inner part of its sclerotium are used separately. M. cocos quality is influenced by geographical origins, so an effective and accurate geographical authentication method is required. Liquid chromatograms at 242 nm and 210 nm (LC242 and LC210) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of two parts were applied to authenticate the geographical origin of cultivated M. cocos combined with low and mid-level data fusion strategies, and partial least squares discriminant analysis. Data pretreatment involved correlation optimized warping and second derivative. The results showed that the potential of the chromatographic fingerprint was greater than that of five triterpene acids contents. LC242-FTIR low-level fusion took full advantage of information synergy and showed good performance. Further, the predictive ability of the FTIR low-level fusion model of two parts was satisfactory. The performance of the low-level fusion strategy preceded those of the single technique and mid-level fusion strategy. The inner parts were more suitable for origin identification than the epidermis. This study proved the feasibility of the data fusion of chromatograms and spectra, and the data fusion of different parts for the accurate authentication of geographical origin. This method is meaningful for the quality control of food and the protection of geographical indication products.

AB The increasing interest in olive varieties with high productivity and quality is the basis of modern olive growing. The molecular characterization of olive varieties is essential to maximize the genetic diversity in the in situ and ex situ collections of the olive germplasm. The importance of studies aimed at identification and selection of genotypes that meet the requirements for plant nursery certification, for oils traceability and to preserve genotypes that are not widespread from risks of extinction, is evident. In this context, DNA fingerprinting represents a valid tool because the productivity and quality of olive oil are intrinsic characteristics of the original varieties. To date, the Albanian olive-growing heritage has been little studied and the number of varieties has not yet been well defined. As a consequence, it doesn't a precise characterization of the Albanian genetic entities. The aim of this work was to contribute in clarifying the identity of the Albanian olive cultivars, using the SSR molecular markers. We have genotyped olive trees at the level of nine nuclear microsatellite loci or SSR, pre-selected among those present in the literature and we have identified 38 unique genotypes. It has not been possible to establish a clear correlation between clustering of plants, depending on molecular profiles, and the geographical distribution of origin or maturation period or the intended use of drupes. However, our results show a high genetic diversity and a high discrimination capacity of the tested SSR markers.

AB The traceability of mineral element fingerprints to mutton in a small area of China was studied. The element data of 104 sheep and 24 goat samples from Inner Mongolia were measured, and the data were analyzed by multivariate statistical analysis from different origins, species and feeding patterns. The results shows that 11 elements (Mg, Al, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Rb, Sr, Ba) in sheep meat had significant differences between different regions (P < 0.05), and the results of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) showed that the accuracy of the original classification rate was 95.2%, and the cross-validation rate was 85.9%. Goat meat and sheep meat samples from Alxa League were also clearly identified with LDA results showing that the cross-validation accuracy of the two species was 70.2%. Then the feeding patterns of sheep meat were effectively classified. The results showed that the multi-element analysis has certain potential as a method to distinguish mutton in a small area.

AB Rice from neighbouring areas and of similar varieties can have a negative impact on classification and identification systems. Hence, it is important to validate methods of identifying similar varieties of rice from neighbouring areas to ensure the traceability of food quality. In this study, Raman spectroscopy and chemometric methods were used to identify and classify 14 similar varieties of rice from neighbouring areas in Northeast China. The Raman spectra of 630 single-grain rice samples were collected, and the original spectra were preprocessed using 9 methods, including Savitzky-Golay (SG) smoothing, normalisation (NL), and polynomial curve fitting (PCF). The original full spectrum (FS), characteristic band spectrum, and the characteristic wavelengths were subsequently extracted via the successive projection algorithm (SPA) in the range of 400-1700 cm(-1) as the partial least squares (PLS) modelling input data. A contrast analysis of the impact of changes in the number of rice species on the accuracy of different modelling, training, and validation sets was performed. Thereafter, the models were optimised using the Kennard-Stone (K/S) sample set partition method. Results showed that different pre-processing methods have varied effects on the modelling. In the FS and SPA feature extraction methods, the fourth polynomial fitting of the PCF had the best recognition effect after pre-processing, and the SG-NL-PCF modelling effect in the band spectrum was optimal. At the same time, with an increase in rice varieties, the recognition rate of the PLS classification model showed a downward trend. At 14 species, FS-PCF-PLS and characteristic bands SG-NL-PCF-PLS and SG-NL-PCF-SPA-PLS were predicted. The correct rate of set recognition was 81.90 %, 92.86 %, and 86.67 %, respectively. After the sample set was divided with K/S, the correct rate of recognition of the three prediction sets was 96.67 %, 97.14 % and 90.95 %, respectively. The Raman spectroscopy technology, combined with the PLS method, can be used to quickly and non-destructively identify multiple types of rice from neighbouring areas. The pre-processing and K/S sample set partition methods can significantly improve the model prediction accuracy.

AB In recent years an effort has been made to improve supply chain management (SCM) and traceability control in different industrial sectors, for example, in agriculture one of the main concerns is about to know where is the product in particular moment and where it will be next. Problem here is, as many other systems, the centralisation of information and trust problems derived from human interaction with transactions in the system. Based on this context of lack of trust, we propose the design and development of a platform using a database based on Blockchain technologies, the platform's main effort is to propose a solution for agriculture SCM and control over internet taking as study case Colombian agriculture negotiation process.

ID GREY THEORY
AB In order to improve the effectiveness of the network prediction result of rice protein interaction, the network prediction method of rice protein interaction based on gray BP neural network has been proposed. Firstly, a series of key features about interaction sites of rice protein such as the series spectrum, conserved weight, entropy value, accessible exterior product of compound and sequence rate, etc., should be extracted firstly. Then the gray BP neural network and their integration will be applied to the training and test of these sample set. Ten times of cross validation are applied to the training and test, and four groups of feature combinations of rice protein interaction with comparability are created. As for each time of the addition of new features in the experiment, the accurate prediction rate would be improved, especially in case of the addition of exterior product and sequence rate features, the accuracy can be improved greatly, which means that in case the combination of multiple features is adopted, the method of predicting the interaction of rice protein by combining the gray BP neural network algorithm is accurate and effective.

AB The paper starts from the assumption that a greater level of sustainability in national food systems can be achieved with the contribution of the consumer. Nowadays, the consumer can condition the choices of the production system, with a greater demand for reassurance on the quality, safety, and traceability of food products. To confirm this hypothesis, this study intends to verify sensitivity to sustainability, purchase behavior, and type of sustainable products in consumer samples of two territorial contexts, the United Arab Emirates and Sicily. The analysis of the results shows the interest of the UAE consumers for organic products and Sicily consumers for local products from a short and zero-kilometer supply chain which is the expression of traditions and opportunities for socio-economic development in the region. The picture is enriched with some food for thought on aspects closely linked to agri-food sustainability.

AB From the perspective of consumer utility, this study conducted a survey-based experimental analysis involving two types of traceable pork hindquarters on grocery shoppers from the city of Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China. Results showed that decoy effect existed in the purchase of traceable pork hindquarters. Furthermore, the decoy effect associated with traceability information reflecting pork quality and safety was higher than that associated with appearance and a comparable price. This study has implications on marketing of food, including pork, and contributes to establishing a multilevel traceable pork system through a combination of different product attributes.

AB Salmonella enterica (S. enterica) is an important foodborne pathogen, causing food poisoning and human infection, and critically threatening food safety and public health. Salmonella typing is essential for bacterial identification, tracing, epidemiological investigation, and monitoring. Serotyping and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis are standard bacterial typing methods despite the low resolution. Core genome MLST (cgMLST) is a high-resolution molecular typing method based on whole genomic sequencing for accurate bacterial tracing. We investigated 250 S. enterica isolates from poultry, livestock, food, and human sources in nine provinces of China from 2004 to 2019 using serotyping, MLST, and cgMLST analysis. All S. enterica isolates were divided into 36 serovars using slide agglutination. The major serovars in order were Enteritidis (31 isolates), Typhimurium (29 isolates), Mbandaka (23 isolates), and Indiana (22 isolates). All strains were assigned into 43 sequence types (STs) by MLST. Among them, ST11 (31 isolates) was the primary ST. Besides this, a novel ST, ST8016, was identified, and it was different from ST40 by position 317 C -> T in dnaN. Furthermore, these 250 isolates were grouped into 185 cgMLST sequence types (cgSTs) by cgMLST. The major cgST was cgST235530 (11 isolates), and only three cgSTs contained isolates from human and other sources, indicating a possibility of cross-species infection. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that most of the same serovar strains were putatively homologous except Saintpaul and Derby due to their multilineage characteristics. In addition, serovar I 4,[5],12:i:- and Typhimurium isolates have similar genomic relatedness on the phylogenetic tree. In conclusion, we sorted out the phenotyping and genotyping diversity of S. enterica isolates in China during 2004-2019 and clarified the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of Salmonella from different hosts in China in the recent 16 years. These results greatly supplement Salmonella strain resources, genetic information, and traceability typing data; facilitate the typing, traceability, identification, and genetic evolution analysis of Salmonella; and therefore, improve the level of analysis, monitoring, and controlling of foodborne microorganisms in China.</p>

AB The paper investigates how food safety investment decisions are affected on the one hand by laws and on the other by firm's economic and organizational drivers. The paper shares findings from an empirical study that considers investments in HACCP, Certification, and Traceability in the Italian meat sector. The main finding of the study is that the allocation of the decision rights to invest in food safety explains the patterns of investment decisions observed. The conclusion is that regulatory interventions are more effective if there is a private possibility to allocate investment decision rights with respect to the distribution of information between private and public agents and the degree of uncertainty. The study contributes to the analysis of the allocation of the decision rights in the organization of value chain. Under this innovative view, it empirically shows how regulation and freedom of contract act as drivers of food safety investments. The research is particularly interesting in its policy implication: information regarding the role of these collective bodies will become relevant in the near future in the context of expected changes in the EU's agricultural policy.

AB The dispersed composition of milk and the properties of its dispersed phases significantly affect the quality of dairy products and its processing. Therefore, the problem of research and control of the dispersed composition of milk is quite important. The article describes the applicability of photon correlation spectroscopy for the analysis and diagnosis of milk dispersion composition. The dispersed composition of milk was studied by photon correlation spectroscopy on the Photocor complex spectrometer. Histograms of the distribution of the hydrodynamic radius of the particles of dispersed phase of milk with different fat content and different manufacturers are obtained. Limitations of this method were also found in the analysis of complex colloidal systems containing more than two different dispersed phases with a significant predominance of quantity of particles. It was found that the reliability of measurement results is significantly affected by the degree of dilution of the studied samples and spectroscopy modes: number of units, duration of unit and the measuring angle. As a result of the experiment the optimal parameters for measuring the dispersed phase of milk with different fat content were determined, which were: dilution ratio-2 times, the angle of the photodetector position - 120-150 degrees, number of units-100, duration of unit - 20 s. The obtained results are planned to be used for the development of guidelines for the introduction of photon correlation spectroscopy in the dairy industry as an express method of analysis in the concept of complete traceability of the quality and safety of dairy products

AB Background: As an emerging and rapidly growing omics field derived from metabolomics, lipidomics focuses on comprehensive analysis of lipid molecules in biological matrices. In recent years, the rapid development of lipidomics approaches using mass spectrometry (MS) has shown great potential in food lipids analysis and dietary lipid nutrition research within foodomics, which brings different strategies that manage to face the complex challenges existed in global food chains and provides comprehensive insights into lipid nutrition and health.
   Scope and approach: This review presents a profile of MS-based lipidomics, from sample preparation to data processing. Analytical strategies, MS-based platforms and chemometric tools that are widely employed in lipidomics researches are summarized. The feasibility of MS-based lipidomics approaches in the field of foodomics has been demonstrated with their recent applications in food traceability, quality, safety, as well as revealing the health benefits of dietary lipids.
   Key findings and conclusions: MS-based lipidomics analysis in foodomics discipline can provide compositional and structural information about lipid components in a food matrix or alteration of lipid metabolism in organisms after diet intervention. When combined with chemometric tools, this powerful platform enables sensitive and robust detection of food fraud, assessment of food safety problems concerning lipid molecules and in-depth investigation of the functional roles of dietary lipids. The advances of MS and progresses in separation techniques will further expand the application of MS-based lipidomics in foodomics research, and thus offering us more new knowledge of food lipids.

AB Maca has shown broad application prospects as a new food resource. The function of maca is directly affected by its geographical origin, and an effective method for studying traceability must be established. This study aimed to discriminate maca from different regions at large scales (Peru and China) and small scales (Yunnan, Xinjiang, and Tibet in China) through geographical authentication using the stable isotope ratio (SIR) (delta C-13, delta N-15, delta H-2 and delta O-18) and mineral elemental fingerprints combined with chemometrics. For Peruvian and Chinese maca, overall discriminatory accuracy of 100% and 96.2% were obtained by applying SIR and the mineral element analysis, respectively. For maca obtained from different Chinese regions, the order of the discriminatory accuracy was mineral elements (80.2%) = SIR combined with mineral elements (80.2%) > SIR (71.9%). K, B, Mn, Fe, Mo, Cd and As were identified as the main discriminating indicators for identifying maca from different Chinese regions.

AB Food safety has been a growing concern among European Union (EU) citizens over the last decades. Despite the fact that food has never been safer, consumers are considerably uncertain and increasingly critical about the safety of their food. The introduction of new principles, such as the primary responsibility of producers, traceability, risk analysis, the separation of risk assessment and risk management provided a more transparent, science-based system in Europe, which can help to restore consumers' lost confidence. The present EU integrated approach to food safety `from farm to fork' aims to assure a high level of food safety within the EU. (C) 2014 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Apple is one of the most important cash crops in China. However, negative economic, environmental and social impacts are associated with its production. This study aims to apply a holistic systems perspective to understand existing problems associated with apple production in China and use this information to improve its sustain ability. A structured survey was administered to farmers (n = 245) in Shandong and Shanxi provinces, combined with semi-structured interviews with apple supply chain stakeholders (n = 25). Themes, dimensions and relationships were identified based on an inductive thematic analysis of interview data, and then triangulated against the survey data. Interpretive Structural Modelling and Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification methods were applied to investigate interrelationships and effects of the elicited elements within the system. The results indicated that various environmental, economic and social problems are associated with apple production in China, including environmental and health risks associated with synthetic input applications, yield instability, deterioration of apple quality, farmers' uncertainty about accessing routes to market, and the ageing farming workforce. The interaction of socio-economic and supply chain issues has contributed to the system "lock-in" to unsustainable practices within the apple production system. Existing agricultural policies were ineffective as they did not include policy leverage to mitigate the multiple factors driving lock-in to unsustainable practices within the system. The research has provided evidence to enable policymakers to develop effective and targeted strategies to facilitate sustainable production within the apple production system. In particular, the future policy mix should consider the entirety of the food system including perspectives and requirements of different stakeholders. The three-stage approach applied has demonstrated its feasibility of investigating sustainability issues facing a particular industry within a specific cultural and policy context.

AB The objective of this work was to devise a complete procedure based on chemometrics and the use NIR spectroscopy at the entrance of a feed mill to provide early evidence of non-conformity and unusual ingredients and thus help to achieve cost-savings. The procedure was validated at laboratory level and was adapted for application at the Cargill Animal Nutrition feed mill. The study focused on the characterisation of pure soybean meal with the aim of creating an early control system for detecting and quantifying any unusual ingredient that might be present in the soybean meal, such as melamine, cyanuric acid or whey powder (milk serum). The study results showed that the use of NIR, combined with some simple chemometric tools based on distances and residuals from regression equations, is appropriate for authenticating important feed products (in this case, soybean meal) and detecting the presence of abnormal samples or impurities in both the laboratory and at the feed mill.

AB Analysis of food or feed samples by DNA-based methods first needs a sample preparation before DNA extraction. Due to the large variety of types of food and feed samples, methods must be adapted to the matrices encountered. Within an accreditation scheme, auditors frequently require a clear decision system enabling the technical staff to determine which method has to be used to perform the sample preparation and the DNA extraction. In this paper, we present an identification key that easily determines the type of matrix and the subsequent operations. The method presented is used in the framework of GMO analysis but could be extended to a wide variety of other DNA-based methods applied to food and feed products.

AB Purpose - This paper argues that there is an absence of halal integrity within the conventional stages of a food chain. This paper adapts the understanding of the different stages and argues the need to develop a critical consciousness for halal integrity within the food chain to address the needs of the ever-growing Muslim consumers' market. The purpose of this paper is to propose a definition of halal integrity using farm to fork and global food supply chain models.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study includes a review of priori literature and media reports regarding cross-contamination of food products with haram (forbidden) components. This background will be used to conceptualise halal integrity using farm to fork and global supply chain models.
   Findings - Different interpretations of halal - what is permitted and what is prohibited - exist for the different schools of Islamic legal thought and within the customs of different countries. In order to ensure that food production is embracive of the religious needs of the global Muslim customer market, this paper utilises the farm to fork and global supply chain models to foster a critical awareness of halal needs. Halal integrity should be clearly presenting the details of the halal status of the product and assuring that the requirements for halal as stated are met. Halal integrity not only deals with permitted and prohibited foods, but that the halal status of the food products (i.e. from raw materials until it reaches the consumers) should not be breached (i.e. no cross-contamination with haram products/methods and no ill intents). A formal definition of halal integrity has been proposed.
   Research limitations/implications - The SWOT analyses serve as a guideline as the analysis done may be outdated as the environments are constantly changing.
   Originality/value - This research although academic is meant to have a real value in improving the integrity of the halal food supply chain, providing value to the food industry, to countries that are concerned about this supply chain and to Muslim consumers. Halal integrity is crucial to the success of the emerging halal market.

AB Sheep are used in many countries as food and for manufacturing bioproducts. However, when these animals consume animal by-products (ABP), which is widely prohibited, there is a risk of transmitting scrapie - a fatal prion disease in human beings. Therefore, it is essential to develop sensitive methods to detect previous ABP intake to select safe animals for producing biopharmaceuticals. We used stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) for C-13 and N-15 to trace animal proteins in the serum of three groups of sheep: 1 - received only vegetable protein (VP) for 89 days; 2 - received animal and vegetable protein (AVP); and 3 - received animal and vegetable protein with animal protein subsequently removed (AVPR). Groups 2 and 3 received diets with 30% bovine meat and bone meal (MBM) added to a vegetable diet (from days 16-89 in the AVP group and until day 49 in the AVPR group, when MBM was removed).
   The AVPR group showed N-15 equilibrium 5 days after MBM removal (54th day). Conversely, N-15 equilibrium in the AVP group occurred 22 days later (76th day). The half-life differed between these groups by 3.55 days. In the AVPR group, N-15 elimination required 53 days, which was similar to this isotope's incorporation time. Turnover was determined based on natural N-15 signatures. IRMS followed by turnover calculations was used to evaluate the time period for the incorporation and elimination of animal protein in sheep serum. The delta C-13 and delta N-15 values were used to track animal protein in the diet. This method is biologically and economically relevant for the veterinary field because it can track protein over time or make a point assessment of animal feed with high sensitivity and resolution, providing a low-cost analysis coupled with fast detection. Isotopic profiles could be measured throughout the experimental period, demonstrating the potential to use the method for traceability and certification assessments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Forty food service establishments were investigated in the Abruzzo region (central Italy) by two physical inspections and in the second one the managers were asked to fill a detailed checklist aiming at verifying the application of good hygiene practices and other regulatory requirements intended to all member states of the European Union. The results showed that training and personal hygiene were observed by most establishments (92.5 and 60%, respectively), as well as sanitation and update of supplier list (from 75 to 100% the first item and 87.5% the last). On the contrary, the major nonconformances regarded the registration documents, above all food traceability (90%), and storage for incoming raw materials (77.5%). The compliance to the investigated requirements did not depend on the size of food service establishment but it was strictly affected by the manager capacity or sensitivity. The specific points of the checklist (personnel, foodstuffs supplier, storage, temperature control, sanitation, personal hygiene, pest control, and registration documents) proposed in this study could facilitate and promote a good management of the food distribution system also to avoid the potential occurrence of health hazards for consumers.
   Practical applicationsThe study deals with the application of good hygiene practices in forty food service establishments located in the Abruzzo region, central Italy. The investigation was achieved with the support of a detailed checklist prepared by the authors and the responses were analyzed by a multiple correspondence analysis and then a cluster analysis. This article can assist the food business operators by providing some suggestions to deliver and ameliorate the potential nonconformances observed in the investigated establishments.

AB BACKGROUND In recent years, tracing of alimentary produce of animal origin has become increasingly important, for economic, food safety and ecological reasons. The tambaqui, Colossoma macropomum, is the native fish most farmed in Brazil. The reliable identification of the origin of tambaquis (wild or farmed) offered for sale to the general public has become necessary to satisfy regulatory norms and uphold consumer confidence. Molecular methods based on the analysis of DNA sequences have often been used to evaluate the potential for tracing farmed fish, given their reliability and precision.
   RESULTS Full likelihood and Bayesian approaches proved to be the most efficient for the identification, respectively, of individuals and populations for most of the fish sampled from seven hatcheries and one wild stock. The exclusion method and genetic distances were the least effective approaches for the identification of individuals and populations. The Bayesian method identified correctly more than 99% of the fry from most stocks, except those of the Santarem hatchery and River Amazon wild stock, which presented the best results for individual identification.
   CONCLUSIONS The identification of populations was effective for most hatcheries, although the identification of individuals from most stocks was hampered by the reduced genetic variability. (c) 2018 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Background: Consumers are increasingly interested in the provenance of the foods and European laws require protection against the mislabelling of premium foods. Methods for testing authenticity require robust analytical techniques that can be utilised by the various regulatory authorities. Of the many techniques, the most widely-used method is stable isotope ratio analysis.
   Scope and approach: Focus is on the use of stable isotope ratios of H, C, N, 0, S and Sr for verifying the geographical origin of food, cross-referencing it with examples of legal cases. State of the art including rules for building an authentic sample reference database (commonly called databank) and for interpreting the results obtained in actual cases is described. The overall objective is to provide stakeholders and competent authorities dealing with fraud, with a best-practice guide for its use.
   Key findings and conclusions: Stable isotope ratios can differentiate foods on the basis of their geographical origin and, especially for light elements, can be measured reliably in routine work in different matrices and compared successfully between different laboratories. Examples of legal applications are grape products, orange juices, olive oil, cheese, butter, caviar. Sometimes, the cases are not brought directly to the court, but before further verifications (e.g. paper traceability, forensic accounting) are conducted. The system can satisfy the court when a robust databank of authentic samples exists, the methods used are officially recognized, validated and accredited, and the expert demonstrates that the conclusions are sufficiently robust and reliable to stand up to the required level of proof.

AB The wine industry has developed rapidly; however, wine fraud is a potential risk for consumers. In China, methods for detecting wine authenticity are far from perfect. To reduce the risk of counterfeit wines, Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry and Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry were used to geographically classify 104 wines from four major production areas. In this paper, the naturally distributed characteristics of thirty-eight mineral elements contents and the effect of rainfall on the oxygen isotope values in wine were investigated. The result of delta O-18 ranged from -13 parts per thousand to 7 parts per thousand. The oxygen isotope of wine water in Northwest China is obviously more positive than that in South China. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) showed 88.5% classification accuracy in training set and 81.7% in the cross-validation result. An artificial neural network (ANN) model determined origin of the wine with higher accuracy than LDA model. Furthermore, delta O-18 and Sr/Rb are important recognition elements in ANN, and the accuracy of region recognition can reach 90.9%. Thus, mineral elements and isotope ratios are effective in contributing to wine authenticity control in wine origin.

AB Black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens, L.) larvae are characterized by their ability to convert a variety of organic matter from food waste into a sustainable source of food (e.g., protein). This study aimed to evaluate the use of attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy to monitor changes in the composition as well as to classify black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) samples collected from two growth stages (fifth and sixth instar) and two waste stream diets (bread and vegetables, soy waste). The BSFL samples were fed on either a soy or bread-vegetable mix waste in a control environment (temperature 25 degrees C, and humidity 70%). The frass and BSFL samples harvested as fifth and sixth instar samples were analyzed using an ATR-MIR instrument where frequencies at specific wavenumbers were compared and evaluated using different chemometric techniques. The PLS regression models yield a coefficient of determination in cross-validation (R-2) > 0.80 for the prediction of the type of waste used as diet. The results of this study also indicated that the ratio between the absorbances corresponding to the amide group (1635 cm(-1)) and lipids (2921 + 2849 cm(-1)) region was higher in diets containing a high proportion of carbohydrates (e.g., bread-vegetable mix) compared with the soy waste diet. This study demonstrated the ability of MIR spectroscopy to classify BSFL instar samples according to the type of waste stream used as a diet. Overall, ATR-MIR spectroscopy has shown potential to be used as tool to evaluate and monitor the development and growth of BSFL. The utilization of MIR spectroscopy will allow for the development of traceability systems for BSFL. These tools will aid in risk evaluation and the identification of hazards associated with the process, thereby assisting in improving the safety and quality of BSFL intended to be used by the animal feed industry.

This definition is applied along the meat industry and also by the human health institutions (Ministry of Public Health and Human Health and Nutrition Departments of the University of the Republic).
   Beyond this concept, for Uruguay as an export country, meat means confidence in terms of food safety, animal welfare, and environmentally friendly production systems. From the plate to the farm, Uruguay joins research, technologies, and production systems to guarantee consumers traceability, safety, nutritive value, and quality of its products. Feeding animals with pastures and avoiding by law the inclusion of hormones, antibiotics, or animal by-product feedstuffs generates an advantage for Uruguay, putting it in front of the new trends in consumer demand.

AB A simple, accurate, and affordable rapid identification technology for authenticating meat species is urgently needed in the food industry. In this study, a chicken-specific polymerase chain reaction combined with a nucleic acid sensor test (Chicken-PCR-Sensor) was developed for fast identification of chicken meat, and its feasibility was evaluated. In this work, gene specific primers and probes were uniquely designed based on certain principles. Chicken mitochondrial DNA underwent targeted amplification by PCR, and the PCR product was directly hybridized to two probes in the PCR solution without need for a secondary hybridization step. The results were assessed using a nucleic acid sensor within 2-3 min. This nucleic acid sensor test provides a visual read-out format for the rapid detection of nucleic acids in field testing. The Chicken-PCR-Sensor test was able to specifically detect chicken and was able to detect as little as 0.01% adulterated chicken in the meat mixture. The robustness of the test was successfully evaluated with commercial food samples. As a promising novel molecular detection tool, this test might have potential applications for evaluating chicken adulteration and traceability given its rapidity, high sensitivity, and simple work flow.

Reference and information values are also reported for nine additional compounds including total alpha-cryptoxanthin, trans- and total lycopene, total alpha-carotene, trans-beta-carotene, and coenzyme Q(10). The certified values for the fat-soluble vitamins and carotenoids in SRM 968e were based on the agreement of results from the means of two liquid chromatographic methods used at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and from the median of results of an interlaboratory comparison exercise among institutions that participate in the NIST Micronutrients Measurement Quality Assurance Program. The assigned values for cholesterol and 25-hydroxyvitamin D-3 in the SRM are the means of results obtained using the NIST reference method based upon gas chromatography-isotope dilution mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. SRM 968e is currently one of two available health-related NIST reference materials with concentration values assigned for selected fat-soluble vitamins, carotenoids, and cholesterol in human serum matrix. This SRM is used extensively by laboratories worldwide primarily to validate methods for determining these analytes in human serum and plasma and for assigning values to in-house control materials. The value assignment of the analytes in this SRM will help support measurement accuracy and traceability for laboratories performing health-related measurements in the clinical and nutritional communities.

AB Livestock welfare assessment helps monitor animal health status to maintain productivity, identify injuries and stress, and avoid deterioration. It has also become an important marketing strategy since it increases consumer pressure for a more humane transformation in animal treatment. Common visual welfare practices by professionals and veterinarians may be subjective and cost-prohibitive, requiring trained personnel. Recent advances in remote sensing, computer vision, and artificial intelligence (AI) have helped developing new and emerging technologies for livestock biometrics to extract key physiological parameters associated with animal welfare. This review discusses the livestock farming digital transformation by describing (i) biometric techniques for health and welfare assessment, (ii) livestock identification for traceability and (iii) machine and deep learning application in livestock to address complex problems. This review also includes a critical assessment of these topics and research done so far, proposing future steps for the deployment of AI models in commercial farms. Most studies focused on model development without applications or deployment for the industry. Furthermore, reported biometric methods, accuracy, and machine learning approaches presented some inconsistencies that hinder validation. Therefore, it is required to develop more efficient, non-contact and reliable methods based on AI to assess livestock health, welfare, and productivity.

AB Compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) usually requires preparative steps (pretreatments, extraction, derivatization) to get amenable chromatographic analytes from bulk geological, biological or synthetic materials. Analytical pyrolysis (Py-GC/MS) can help to overcome such sample manipulation. This communication describe the results obtained by hyphenating analytical pyrolysis (Py-GC) with carbon isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) for the analysis of a polylactic acid (PLA) a based bio-plastic extruded with variable quantities of a natural plant extract or oregano essential oil. The chemical structural information of pyrolysates was first determined by conventional analytical pyrolysis and the measure of delta C-13 in specific compounds was done by coupling a pyrolysis unit to a gas chromatograph connected to a continuous flow IRMS unit (Py-GC-C-IRMS). Using this Py-CSIA device it was possible to trace natural additives with depleted delta C-13 values produced by C3 photosystem vegetation (cymene: -26.7 parts per thousand +/- 2.52; terpinene: 27.1 parts per thousand +/- 0.13 and carvacrol: 27.5 parts per thousand +/- 1.80 from oregano and two unknown structures: -23.3 parts per thousand +/- 3.32 and - 24.4 parts per thousand +/- 1.70 and butyl valerate: -24.1 parts per thousand +/- 3.55 from Allium spp.), within the naturally isotopically enriched bio-plastic backbone derived from corn.(C4 vegetation) starch (cyclopentanones: 14.2 parts per thousand +/- 2.11; lactide enantiomers: -9.2 parts per thousand +/- 1.56 and larger polymeric units: 17.2%, 1.71).
   This is the first application of Py-CSIA to characterize a bio-plastic and is shown as a promising tool to study such materials, providing not only a fingerprinting, but also valuable information about the origin of the materials, allowing the traceability of additives and minimizing sample preparation.

AB Beef consumption and production in Spain and Brazil are different with the consumption of beef in Brazil being three times higher than in Spain. In addition, there are variations in the economic value of production and in the traceability system. Therefore, the aim of this research was to understand the purchasing and consumption patterns using the customer behavior analysis technique of focus groups, which analyzed motivations for the consumption of beef, classifying their preferences by the intrinsic and extrinsic attributes at the time of purchase. The key aspect of the consumption of beef, both for Spanish and Brazilian consumers, was personal satisfaction/flavor. Spanish consumers were more conscious than Brazilians of the beneficial and harmful qualities that meat provides. The presence of fat was the factor that most restricted intake in both countries. The most important intrinsic attributes for Spanish and Brazilian consumers were the visual aspects of the meat: color, freshness, and the quantity and disposition of fat. The most important extrinsic characteristics were the price and expiration date. Spanish consumers see packaged meat as convenient and safe, although it is considered by Brazilians to be over-manipulated. The traceability certification on the label provides credibility to the product for the Spanish but only partially for Brazilians.

AB Hydrogen isotope ratios (delta H-2) have become a tool for food traceability and authentication of agricultural products. The principle is that the isotopic composition of the produce is influenced by environmental and biological factors and hence exhibits a spatial differentiation of delta H-2. This study investigates the variation in delta H-2 values of New Zealand milk, both in the bulk powder and individual fatty acids extracted from milk samples from dairy factories across New Zealand. Multivariate statistical analyses were used to test for relationships between delta H-2 of bulk milk powder, milk fatty acid and geographical location. Milk powder samples from different regions of New Zealand were found to exhibit patterns in isotopic composition similar to the corresponding regional precipitation associated with their origin.
   A model of delta H-2 in precipitation was developed based on measurements between 2007 and 2010 at 51 stations across New Zealand (Frew and Van Hale, 2011). The model uses multiple linear regressions to predict daily delta H-2 from 2 geographic and 5 rain-weighted climate variables from the 5 x 5 km New Zealand Virtual Climate Station Network (VCSN). To approximate collection radius for a drying facility the modelled values were aggregated within a 50 km radius of each dairy factory and compared to observed delta H-2 values of precipitation and bulk milk powder. Daily delta H-2 predictions for the period from August to December for the area surrounding the sample collection sites were highly correlated with the delta H-2 values of bulk milk powder. Therefore the delta H-2 value of milk fatty acids demonstrates promise as a tool for determining the provenance of milk powders and products where milk powder is an ingredient. Separation of milk powder origin to geographic sub-regions within New Zealand was achieved. Hydrogen isotope measurements could be used to complement traditional tracking systems in verifying point of origin. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Fisheries products are some of the most traded commodities world-wide and the potential for fraud is a serious concern. Fish fraud represents a threat to human health and poses serious concerns due to the consumption of toxins, highly allergenic species, contaminates or zoonotic parasites, which may be present in substituted fish. The substitution of more expensive fish by cheaper species, with similar morphological characteristics but different origins, reflects the need for greater transparency and traceability upon which which the security of the entire seafood value-chain depends. Even though EU regulations have made significant progress in consumer information by stringent labelling requirements, fraud is still widespread. Many molecular techniques such as DNA barcoding provide valuable support to enhance the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) in the protection of consumer interests by unequivocally detecting any kind of fraud. This paper aims to highlight both the engagement of EU fishery policy and the opportunity offered by new biotechnology instruments to mitigate the growing fraud in the globalized fish market and to enforce the food security system to protect consumers' health. In this paper, after a presentation of EU rules on fish labeling and a general overview on the current state of the global fish market, we discuss the public health implications and the opportunities offered by several techniques based on genetics, reporting a case study to show the efficacy of the DNA barcoding methodology in assessing fish traceability and identification, comparing different species of the Epinephelus genus, Mottled Grouper (Mycteroperca rubra) and Wreckfish (Polyprion americanus), often improperly sold with the commercial name of "grouper".

AB This study focused on the feasibility and stability of electronic nose in differentiating kiwi fruit according to geographical origin. Ninety kiwi fruit samples with protected designation of origin were collected from Hunan, Shaanxi, and Sichuan Provinces of China respectively. The freeze-dried kiwi fruit samples were analyzed by a PEN3 portable electronic nose coupled with pattern recognition techniques. The stability of traceability based on this method was also investigated. The difference analysis results indicated that kiwi fruit samples from different regions had their unique aroma compounds fingerprint characteristics. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed a good visualization of clusters between regions, and freeze-dried samples (before or after storage) from the three areas were successfully identified by stepwise discriminant analysis (SLDA) and soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA). Therefore, it was acceptable that the electronic nose is cost-effective, practical and could be used as a potential technology for protecting or authenticating specialty agricultural products and geographical indication. But its stability for tracing needs to be further enhanced.

AB In the present work, a novel infrared-assisted extraction coupled to headspace solid-phase microextraction ( IRAE-HS-SPME) followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ( GC-MS) was developed for rapid determination of the volatile components in green tea. The extraction parameters such as fiber type, sample amount, infrared power, extraction time, and infrared lamp distance were optimized by orthogonal experimental design. Under optimum conditions, a total of 82 volatile compounds in 21 green tea samples from different geographical origins were identified. Compared with classical water-bath heating, the proposed technique has remarkable advantages of considerably reducing the analytical time and high efficiency. In addition, an effective classification of green teas based on their volatile profiles was achieved by partial least square-discriminant analysis ( PLS-DA) and hierarchical clustering analysis ( HCA). Furthermore, the application of a dual criterion based on the variable importance in the projection ( VIP) values of the PLS-DA models and on the category from one-way univariate analysis ( ANOVA) allowed the identification of 12 potential volatile markers, which were considered to make the most important contribution to the discrimination of the samples. The results suggest that IRAE-HS-SPME/GC-MS technique combined with multivariate analysis offers a valuable tool to assess geographical traceability of different tea varieties.

AB The determination of honey authenticity is of importance to ensure its quality and safety. There is an urgent need of effective methods to detect adulterated honey. A simple, rapid, and effective HPLC-DAD method was developed to detect honey adulteration by rice syrup, using a characteristic compound from rice syrup, which is presently difficult to detect by current analytical methods. The characteristic compound was identified as 2-acetylfuran-3-glucopyranoside (AFGP) by MS and NIv1R. Based on HPLC analyses, the average concentration of AFGP was 92 +/- 60 mg/kg in rice syrup. However, AFGP was not detected in any of the natural honey samples, so it could be used as a marker for the detection of honey adulteration by rice syrup. The developed method enabled a rapid detection of honey samples adulterated with 1096 rice syrup. Using the developed method, 16 out of 186 honey samples from some markets were found to be adulterated with rice syrup.

AB Introduction. Genetically modified crops (GMC) are of particular interest due to their impact on the global economy. Therefore, as a general concern, many countries have established some regulations in regards to genetically modified organisms (GMOs). In Costa Rica, the cultivation of GMOs has been practiced since 1991; however, there ' s a lack of studies that monitor the execution and compliance with the biosafety regulations. Objective. The objective of the present study was to identify the presence or absence of transgenicity in processed foods for human and animal consumption, as well as in cotton seeds. Material and methods. The real-time PCR technique was used to target the 35S promoter sequence, derived from the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV), as a marker to detect the presence of transgenes in processed foods for human and animal consumption as well as in wild or cultivated cotton seeds collected nearby a GM cotton farm in May 2017. Results. In the analyzed samples there was a high incidence of an 82 bp fragment, corresponding to the 35S promoter sequence, being absent only in organic corn crops and their derivatives (tortillas, corn powder). Results suggest the presence of GMO traces in the Costa Rican food market, additionally it reveals the urgency of implementing adequate labeling for food traceability. Furthermore, the presence of transgenic cotton in the vicinity of a GM cotton farm was identified, suggesting the relevance of surveillance in aspects of biosafety and genetic manipulation of crops. Conclusion. The presence of traces for GMOs in Costa Rican processed food, demonstrates the importance of continuing this monitoring to provide enough elements for a critic discussion about food traceability and potential transgene flow into wild plant material.

AB Geographical origin discrimination of agro-products is essential to guarantee food safety and fair trade. Garlic samples cultivated in six provinces or major production regions in China were characterized for stable isotopes (delta 13C, delta 2H, delta 18O, delta 15N, and delta 34S), bioelemental contents (% C, % N and % S), and sulfur-containing compounds (8 organosulfur components and 2 amino acids). Results showed that many of the 18 analyzed garlic variables had significant differences among production regions. Some sulfur-containing compounds found in garlic from different provinces had a strong correlation with sulfur isotopes, suggesting garlic sulfur isotopes were also affected by geographical origin. Two supervised pattern recognition models (PLS-DA and k-NN) were developed using stable isotopes, elemental contents, and sulfur-containing compounds, and had a discrimination accuracy of 93.4 % and 87.8 %, respectively. Chemometric classification models using multi-isotopes, elements and sulfurcontaining compounds provides a useful method to authenticate Chinese garlic origins.

AB Body measurement is an important link in monitoring the growth of livestock in breeding management. Conventional measurements are notoriously difficult, unstable, stressful and time-consuming. 3D Computer vision technology has demonstrated its superiority in body size measurement and live body weight estimation because it has advantages of being both non-contact and effective. The objective of this paper was validating the use of single-frame surface point clouds to measure the body size, and develop a model to estimate the pig weight. With a limit bar not applied, a Kinect camera was fixed above the drinking area allowed multiple images of pigs to be captured at one time in a group-house. Body size parameters were extracted from back surface point clouds, and subsequently used as independent variables to build the three regression analysis models: i) stepwise regression analysis, ii) ridge regression analysis, and iii) partial least squares regression analysis. An experiment was conducted on fifty pigs in a group-house, half of which were Landrace gilts, half were Yorkshire shoats. The result of size measurement showed the mean relative absolute errors of body length, height, shoulder width were 0.7%, 1.8%, and 3.3%, respectively. Final ridge regression equation was developed with an R-2 of 0.958 and a MAE of 2.961 kg. It was concluded that the proposed methods based on Kinect v2 was shown to be accurate and reliable for body size measurement and live body mass estimation. (C)2022 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   KNOWLEDGE
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine urban households' willingness to pay (WTP) for milk safety and to analyze the factors affecting WTP premiums using data obtained from surveys conducted in Samsun and Trabzon provinces, Turkey.
   Design/methodology/approach - Contingent valuation and censoring methods including the error-dependent bivariate Heckman SS model were used for estimating WTP for milk safety and its effective factors, respectively.
   Findings - The study indicates that 68 percent of the households were willing to pay 0.35 per liter for improving the safety of milk. The model results show that satisfaction with food safety standards, being married and full-time employment have statistically significant positive effects on the WTP for ISO-certified milk. However, purchasing milk from farmers or open-air markets, age, having a child six-year old or younger, and high school or higher education have statistically significant negative effects on the WTP for ISO-certified milk.
   Research limitations/implications - The main limitation of the current study is that only urban consumers' WTP and effective factors for milk safety were examined in two provinces of Turkey.
   Practical implications - More rigorous implementations of food safety standards, traceability systems and effective educational campaigns could promote households' food safety awareness and increase their demand for milk safety.
   Social implications - Knowing what factors are involved in consumer WTP is extremely important for decision makers to create new social policies in the region or country.
   Originality/value - A similar study has not been conducted in Turkey. The novelty of this study is the specification and robust estimation of three different but competing models to reveal the wide range of WTP amounts for safe milk.

AB The objective of this study was to assess the potential of visible and near infrared spectroscopy (VIS+NIRS) combined with multivariate analysis for identifying the geographical origin of cork. The study was carried out on cork planks and natural cork stoppers from the most representative cork-producing areas in the world. Two training sets of international and national cork planks were studied. The first set comprised a total of 479 samples from Morocco, Portugal, and Spain, while the second set comprised a total of 179 samples from the Spanish regions of Andalusia, Catalonia, and Extremadura. A training set of 90 cork stoppers from Andalusia and Catalonia was also studied. Original spectroscopic data were obtained for the transverse sections of the cork planks and for the body and top of the cork stoppers by means of a 6500 Foss-NIRSystems SY II spectrophotometer using a fiber optic probe. Remote reflectance was employed in the wavelength range of 400 to 2500 nm. After analyzing the spectroscopic data, discriminant models were obtained by means of partial least square (PLS) with 70% of the samples. The best models were then validated using 30% of the remaining samples. At least 98% of the international cork plank samples and 95% of the national samples were correctly classified in the calibration and validation stage. The best model for the cork stoppers was obtained for the top of the stoppers, with at least 90% of the samples being correctly classified. The results demonstrate the potential of VIS + NIRS technology as a rapid and accurate method for predicting the geographical origin of cork plank and stoppers.

AB Seafood is a highly traded commodity and 71% of the United States (U.S.) supply is imported. This study addresses questions about imported seafood safety and compares risks of outbreaks and recalls across countries of origin, species, and stages of the supply chain. We found that where seafood comes from does not play a major role in risk. Risk is a function of the activities happening at each stage of the supply chain, inherent riskiness of some products or processes, and ?pass through? risks introduced at upstream and midstream stages of the supply chain. Dominant farmed species (shrimp, tilapia, catfish) became less risky as they move along the supply chain toward consumers. We recommend investments in agencies overseeing food safety and health, enhanced traceability within supply chains, and more open government datasets that support systems-level analyses.

AB Food safety issues often arise from asymmetric information between consumers and suppliers with regards to product-specific attributes. Severe food safety scandals were observed recently in China. These events not only caused direct economic and life losses, but also created distrust in the Chinese food system domestically, as well as internationally. While much attention has focused on the problems plaguing the Chinese government's food inspection system, little research has been dedicated to analyzing Chinese consumers' concerns surrounding food safety. In this paper, we measure consumer preferences for select food safety attributes in pork and take food safety risk perceptions into account. Several choice experiment models, including latent class and random parameters logit, are constructed to capture heterogeneity in consumer preferences. Our results suggest that Chinese consumers have the highest willingness-to-pay for a government certification program, followed by third-party certification, a traceability system, and a product-specific information label. The results of this study call for the direct involvement of the Chinese government in the food safety system. A stricter monitoring system will not only improve consumer well-being in the short-run, but also restore consumers' trust leading to a social welfare increase in the long run. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The need to support food labelling has driven to the development of PCR-based techniques suitable for food analysis. DNA-based markers have been successfully employed for varietal tracing in Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) olive oils. In this study, we report a fast, sensitive, and easy-to-use strategy for PDO olive varietal identification. To achieve this aim four different DNA extraction methods were tested and compared, based on initial volume, extraction time, the gDNA concentration, and quality ratios. The optimized DNA extraction protocol from extra virgin olive oils, based on CTAB-hexane-chloroform extraction, proved to be the most effective. High-resolution melting (HRM) DNA assay was developed based on nuclear microsatellites (gSSR) and plastid DNA (cpDNA) aiming an accurate identification of the olive varieties present in the olive oil samples. After PCR reproducibility evaluation, six molecular markers: three SSRs and three cpDNA loci were chosen based on their discrimination power. The SSR-HRM strategy assays were designed to target UDO99-011, UDO99-039, UDO99-024, and ssrOeUA-DCA16 loci. All SSR-PCR products generated from these primers were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis (CE) for HRM data validation. The SSR coupled with HRM melting curve analysis generated 14 HRM profiles sufficient to genotype all varieties, highlighting their potential use for varietal discrimination. The locus ssrOeUA-DCA16 generated a specific melting curve that allow a high-throughput discrimination of the Picual and Cobrancosa varieties in olive oil samples. Further, the UDO99-024 was also tested by SSR-HRM assay in commercial olive oil samples with promising results. Considering time, cost, and performance SSR-HRM proved to be a reliable method suitable for varietal tracing of olive oils.
   Practical ApplicationOlive oil authenticity is a form of protecting producers and consumers against fraudulent practices. Herein, we present a DNA barcode suitable for the identification of olive varieties, allowing an accurate identification of the olive varieties in olive oil samples using SSR-HRM assay. Its applicability in commercial olive oil samples is viable. This methodology can be used as a tool for Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) adulterations detection.

AB We carried out comprehensive mapping of volatile compounds in 70 wines, from 48 wineries and 6 vintages, representative of the two main production areas for Italian sparkling wines, by HS-SPME-GCxGC-TOF-MS and multivariate analysis. The final scope was to describe the metabolomics space of these wines, and to verify whether the grape cultivar signature, the pedoclimatic influence of the production area, and the complex technology were measurable in the final product. The wine chromatograms provided a wealth of information, with 1695 compounds being found.
   A large number of putative markers influenced by the cultivation area was observed. A subset of 196 biomarkers fully discriminated between the two types of sparkling wines investigated.
   Among the new compounds, safranal and a-isophorone were observed. We showed how correlation-based network analysis could be used as a tool to detect the differences in compound behaviour based on external/environmental influences. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A framework of establishing standard reference scale (texture) is proposed by multivariate statistical analysis according to instrumental measurement and sensory evaluation. Multivariate statistical analysis is conducted to rapidly select typical reference samples with characteristics of universality, representativeness, stability, substitutability, and traceability. The reasonableness of the framework method is verified by establishing standard reference scale of texture attribute (hardness) with Chinese well-known food. More than 100 food products in 16 categories were tested using instrumental measurement (TPA test), and the result was analyzed with clustering analysis, principal component analysis, relative standard deviation, and analysis of variance. As a result, nine kinds of foods were determined to construct the hardness standard reference scale. The results indicate that the regression coefficient between the estimated sensory value and the instrumentally measured value is significant (R-2 = 0.9765), which fits well with Stevens's theory. The research provides reliable a theoretical basis and practical guide for quantitative standard reference scale establishment on food texture characteristics.

AB The accuracy, repeatability and detection limits of the energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer used in this study were tested to verify its suitability for rapid screening of cadmium in samples. Concentrations of cadmium in rice grain samples were tested by the XRF spectrometer. The results showed that the apparatus had good precision around the national limit value (0.2 mg/kg). Raman spectroscopy has been analyzed in the discrimination of rice grain samples from different geographical origins within China. Scanning time has been discussed in order to obtain better Raman features of rice samples. A total of 31 rice samples were analyzed. After spectral data pre-treatment, principal component analysis (PCA), K-means clustering (KMC), hierarchical clustering (HC) and support vector machine (SVM) were performed to discriminate origins of rice samples. The results showed that the geographical origins of rice could be classified using Raman spectroscopy combined with multivariate analysis.

AB BACKGROUNDNeohesperidin is an important natural flavanone glycoside distributed in several citrus species. This compound is widely used as a raw material for food additives in the food industry. The request for certified reference materials (CRMs) in dietary supplements was stipulated by the National Administrative Committee for CRMs and was underpinned by the need to improve the accuracy and comparability of measurement data and to establish metrological traceability of analytical results.
   RESULTSThis paper reports the sample preparation methodology, homogeneity and stability studies, value assignment and uncertainty estimation of a new certified reference material of neohesperidin (GBW09522). Differential scanning calorimetry, coulometric titration and mass balance methods proved to be sufficiently reliable and accurate for certification purposes. The certified value of neohesperidin CRM is 994 g kg(-1) with an expanded uncertainty of 4 g kg(-1) (k = 2). The reference material described above was homogeneous and stable for 12 months at a storage temperature of 25 degrees C.
   CONCLUSIONThe new CRM of neohesperidin can be used to validate analytical methods and improve the accuracy of measurement data as well as quality control of neohesperidin-related dietary supplements, foods, traditional herbs and pharmaceutical formulations. (c) 2014 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Herbal materials have been widely used as functional food by a certain group of people for a potentially positive effect on body health regulation. Panax notoginseng as a crude material of functional food has long medical and cultivation history for more than 400 years in China and other countries. However, the quality was fluctuated with their geographical origins and Wenshan Autonomous Prefecture was regarded as the geo-authentic location with high properties. Therefore, rapid detection method is necessary for consumer to discriminate their authentic origins. In our study, 258 near infrared spectra of root powder of P. notoginseng from five main cultivation areas were used for discrimination analysis. A deep learning strategy (residual convolutional neural network) was established with 80% spectra images. Therein, the discrimination of geographical origins of the herb was first to be reported using directly spectra images instead of data matric from these spectra. The results indicated that these samples could be correctly classified as their respective categories with 100% accuracy in training set and 91% accuracy in test set. Finally, 22 samples were accurately discriminated in 25 samples of prediction set. In general, residual convolutional neural network using direct spectra image would be a feasible strategy for geographical traceability in further discrimination research.

AB In this work, two methods, which were visible near-infrared spectroscopy (VNIRS) and visible near-infrared spectroscopy combined with colorimetric sensor array (VNIRS-CSA), were used to identify the volatile compound changes of rice samples stored for 0 to 6 months. Principal component analysis (PCA), interval partial least squares (iPLS), and synergy interval partial least squares (SiPLS) were used for qualitative classification. A prediction model was established by linear discriminant analysis (LDA), which was compared with the traditional VNIRS detection technology. The results revealed that the VNIRS-CSA got better performance than VNIRS and exhibited a good result based on iPLS/SiPLS-PCA/LDA models. Furthermore, spectral data from VNIRS-CSA were the best for LDA with a high prediction value of 0.925 after standard normal variate (SNV) processing and variable selection by SiPLS. The research demonstrated that VNIRS-CSA is a quick, accurate, and non-destructive method for monitoring the storage time of rice. The strategy also has the potential for volatile organic components analysis.

AB Hazelnut is one of the most commonly consumed tree nuts, being largely used by the food industry in a wide variety of processed foods. However, it is a source of allergens capable of inducing mild to severe allergic reactions in sensitized individuals. Hence, the development of highly sensitive methodologies for hazelnut traceability is essential. In this work, we developed a novel technique for hazelnut detection based on a single-tube nested real-time PCR system. The system presents high specificity and sensitivity, enabling a relative limit of detection of 50 mg/kg of hazelnut in wheat material and an absolute limit of detection of 0.5 pg of hazelnut DNA (1 DNA copy). Its application to processed food samples was successfully achieved, detecting trace amounts of hazelnut in chocolate down to 60 mg/kg. These results highlight the adequacy of the technique for the specific detection and semiquantitation of hazelnut as potential hidden allergens in foods.

AB Based on data for 812 Chinese farmers and a conditional mixed process (CMP) approach, this paper investigates the impact of farmers' e-commerce participation on their awareness of green production. Main results include: (1) e-commerce participation increases farmers' overall awareness of green production by 0.771 (i.e. 0.88 standard deviations); meanwhile such impact is more evident for old-generation, low-income and small-scale farmers; (2) risk awareness is most affected among three sub-dimensions; (3) three influencing channels are confirmed, which are improving information acquisition, strengthening connections with the food market, and alleviating information asymmetry. This paper concludes that e-commerce can play a significant role in promoting the green transition of farmers and agricultural production. As for implications, policymakers need to further promote e-commerce in agriculture while building a more solid food system, including green food certification and a full chain traceability system. However, farmers' heterogeneities should be considered when any intervention is proposed.

AB China is the largest global consumer of infant milk formula (IMF). Chinese consumer preferences towards IMF have evolved over time but have also been rocked in recent years by COVID-19 with major implications for the IMF industry, globally and within China. This study is the first to document parents' preferences toward IMF since the outbreak. We used novel methods to do so, through an online choice experiment of 804 participants that included risk perceptions and socio-demographic variables. Our study finds that Chinese parents continue to prioritize quality and safety attributes of IMF represented by functional ingredients, organic labelling and traceability information. Notably, it also finds greatly increased confidence in Chinese domestically produced IMF and an underlying preference away from expensive products. This implies that the era of 'go for foreign' and 'go for the most expensive' in IMF purchasing may be coming to an end. The shift in sentiment is driven by the longer-term revitalization of the Chinese dairy industry, accelerated by COVID-19. Understanding these trends will be of major benefit to both Chinese producers and non-Chinese exporters of IMF.

AB Olive (Olea europaea L.) represents one of the most important and ancient crops in the Mediterranean countries, being widely known due to the optimal organoleptic characteristics of its oil, besides the important health benefits assigned to this product in the last few years. Since olive oil composition, respecting specific trace elements, has a direct impact on the quality and safety of this product, eleven monovarietal and twelve commercial olive oils were analysed spectrometrically concerning their metal composition. Regarding quality parameters, the monovarietal olive oils display larger quantities of Mg, Fe, Mn, while the commercial samples are characterized by greater amounts of Na, Ca, Cu and Zn. In which respects to safety parameters, the commercial samples present higher values for Al and Pb, and lower quantities of Cd, respecting the monovarietal ones. The assessment of the values observed for the trace elements, resorting to multivariate statistical methods, allowed to clearly distinguish the type of olive oil production monovarietal or commercial blend. For this purpose, besides Cluster analysis, the data have been subjected to Principal Component Analysis undertaken for either all the evaluated parameters simultaneously, or the quality/safety parameters separately, both data sets allowing the discrimination of the samples.

TI The Sino-Brazilian beef supply chain: mapping and risk detection

ID MANAGEMENT; EXAMPLE; EXPORT
AB Purpose - The flow of the Sino-Brazilian frozen beef trade has intensified. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to characterize the supply chain structure, and identify its major fragilities.
   Design/methodology/approach - Supply chain mapping was conducted based on the existing literature and primary data collection. Key stakeholders were detected and questioned through semi-structured interviews, which were later interpreted with content analysis.
   Findings - The results reveal a low degree of chain coordination from the Brazilian farm to the Chinese consumer, arising from an immature traceability mechanism, a limited flow of reliable information between the segments, and low trust between the stakeholders.
   Research limitations/implications - The infancy of the beef trade, the paucity of literature on the topic, and restricted accessibility to key governmental and official materials imposes limits on the available information. Language and cultural barriers might have also impacted the interviewees' responses. However, the participation of Brazilian and Chinese academics in both the interview analysis and chain mapping mitigates these shortcomings.
   Practical implications - The Brazilian public and private sectors need to establish a reliable traceability system and information platform. This, together with investments in marketing and branding, would facilitate differential responses among traders and consumers, and, hence, improve supply chain sustainability.
   Originality/value - By adopting an inter-country approach and directly sourcing views from specific key figures in the supply chain this study offers some unique insights and contributes to the literature on the emergence of a multi-polar global food trade.

AB Present work was designed to know the inter-species genetic variation by detecting polymorphisms and analysing the nucleotide sequences of cytochrome b gene. Blood samples were collected from apparently healthy adult animals of indigenous goat, sheep and pig of Asom, and mitochondrial DNA was extracted for amplification by PCR. One half of the PCR product was used for restriction digestion while the other half after purification was sent for sequencing. Species specific restriction patterns were observed for cytochrome b gene amplicon upon digestion with AluI, HinfI, and HaeIII. The nucleotide sequence results were further analyzed using ClustalW and Mega5 softwares for unambiguous species typing. The percent similarity study showed that goat cytochrome b gene had 89.64 and 82.12% similarity with sheep and pig respectively. Phylogenetic tree also revealed close relationship of goat and sheep cytochrome b gene. Lowest pair wise distance was observed between goat and sheep (0.123) followed by goat and pig (0.227). Pig and sheep cytochrome b gene showed the highest degree of pair wise distance (0.255) between the nucleotides. From the present study, it can be concluded that RFLP and sequence analysis of cytochrome b gene provided the information about the extent of inter-species genetic diversity and can be used as a powerful tool for genetic traceability of species.

AB Gentiana rigescens Franch. ex Hemsl has long been used as a phytotherapeutic agent in various ethno-medical systems of East Asia, especially in China. However, the quality of medicinal materials varies from different geographical regions, so it is necessary to establish a fast and reliable geographical authentication method. In our study, roots, stems and leaves of G. rigescens from eight different origins (including 873 individuals) of southwest China were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra combined with pattern recognition technology, including principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) methods. Two information fusion methods combined with two data mining methods were used to further im prove the classification performance. The results showed that PCA could hardly distinguish these origins. PLS-DA model was more suitable for the geographical origins classification. The classification performance of PLS-DA model based on the leaf FTIR matrix was better than those based on root datasets, which indicated that leaf tissues could be employed in the identification of geographical origins of G. rigescens effectively. In addition, the full spectral information derived from the fusion of infrared spectra in different regions showed the best ability to identify the geographical origins of wild G. rigescens, which had the potential to be a promising analytical tool for rapidly geographical authentication of more valuable herbal medicines.

AB Vibrio parahaemolyticus which naturally inhabits marine and estuarine environment represents pathogenic strains (virulence genes tdh or trh positive) and non-pathogenic strains (virulence genes negative). In this study, a rapid method for subtyping pathogenic and non-pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus was established using fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with chemometric analysis. This method targeted three strains of genotypes of V. parahaemolyticus including tdh positive, trh positive and virulence gene-negative (nonpathogenic) V. parahaemolyticus. The FTIR absorption spectra between 1800 and 900 cm(-1) highlighted the most distinctive variations and were the most useful for characterizing the three bacteria. The successful differentiation and identification of the three bacteria could be accomplished in less than 1 h by FTIR using principal component analysis (PCA), or another cluster model of hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). The method was verified by analyzing spiked V. parahaemolyticus fish samples. Furthermore, all of ten clinical isolates of V. parahaemolyticus were identified as tdh-positive, none of the clinical isolates were n h-positive, and all of ten environmental isolates were identified as non-pathogenic by the subtyping method, which were confirmed by PCR assays. All data demonstrated that the newly established subtyping method by FTIR is practical, time-saving, labor-saving, specific and cost-effective, especially suitable for the basic laboratories of CDC and port quarantine departments to perform suiveillance and epidemiological traceability of pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus.

AB Frequent food quality and safety issues result in various food inspection measures in China, while some are not widely acknowledged by the public and are less efficient. Consumer demand is significant for priority setting in food policy. This study investigates Chinese consumers' heterogeneous preferences for selected food inspection measures and estimates welfare effects based on willingness-to-pay (WTP) calculation. Rice consumption data from a 2018 nationwide consumer survey designed using the real choice experiment is analyzed by the random parameters logit and the latent class model. The findings reveal that consumers place a high value on government certification, and brand is valuable especially when public management is perceived as weak. However, the insufficient market demand for third-party certification may increase transaction costs due to overlapping functions and consumers' distrust. Moreover, there should be a need to broaden consumers' understanding of traceability and grading systems. This study emphasizes the necessity of direct governmental involvement and the existence of unnecessary policy cost.

AB Multi-functionality of agriculture and rural areas has an impact on the economy, the environment, nature and also on societal and cultural development. The dimensions of multi-functionality are interpreted in literature in many different ways, but they always deal with environmental, social and economic aspects. The measurement of the multi-functionality of the agri-food system is an important issue, as it allows the value chain to be interpreted under the lens of sustainable development pillars. In this paper, we argue that multi-functionality is a value, which extends its benefits along the entire agri-food chain. We present a methodology to aggregate indicators into an evaluation framework, in order to assess the level of multi-functionality along the entire food value chain. We have called this the "extended value" of multi-functionality, since our approach is able to consider not only the farm level, but also extends to the entire food chain. To analyse multi-functionality, it was necessary to build Non-Commodity Categories (NCC) based on Non-Commodity Output (NCO), which characterised the value added function along the agri-food value chain. A set of indicators was developed to measure the level of multi-functionality in each NCC. The Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (MCDA) methodology ELECTRE III was used to implement an evaluation process by assigning specific importance to each indicator. This process aggregated the evaluations of multiple indicators into an integrated interpretation, and aimed to support policy makers by providing a ranking of alternative ruling policies for the agri-food value chain. We finally tested our methodological approach on the value chain for the olive oil of five European countries, to analyse which value chain was able to generate more beneficial functions above and beyond the product itself.

AB Food security is one of major concerns for the growing global population. Modern agricultural biotechnologies, such as genetic modification, are a possible solution through enabling an increase of production, more efficient use of natural resources, and reduced environmental impacts. However, new crop varieties with altered genetic materials may be subjected to safety assessments to fulfil the regulatory requirements, prior to marketing. The aim of the assessment is to evaluate the impact of products from the new crop variety on human, animal, and the environmental health. Although, many studies on the risk assessment of genetically modified (GM) food have been published, little consideration to GM feedstuff has been given, despite that between 70 to 90% of all GM crops and their biomass are used as animal feed. In addition, in some GM plants such as forages that are only used for animal feeds, the assessment of the genetic modification may be of relevance only to livestock feeding. In this article, the regulatory framework of GM crops intended for animal feed is reviewed using the available information on GM food as the baseline. Although, the majority of techniques used for the safety assessment of GM food can be used in GM feed, many plant parts used for livestock feeding are inedible to humans. Therefore, the concentration of novel proteins in different plant tissues and level of exposure to GM feedstuff in the diet of target animals should be considered. A further development of specific methodologies for the assessment of GM crops intended for animal consumption is required, in order to provide a more accurate and standardized assessment to the GM feed safety.

AB Accurate pedigree information is critical to animal breeding systems to ensure the highest rate of genetic gain and management of inbreeding. The abundance of available genomic data, together with development of high throughput genotyping platforms, means that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are now the DNA marker of choice for genomic selection studies. Furthermore the superior qualities of SNPs compared to microsatellite markers allows for standardization between laboratories; a property that is crucial for developing an international set of markers for traceability studies. The objective of this study was to develop a high throughput SNP assay for use in the New Zealand sheep industry that gives accurate pedigree assignment and will allow a reduction in breeder input over lambing. This required two phases of development- firstly, a method of extracting quality DNA from ear-punch tissue performed in a high throughput cost efficient manner and secondly a SNP assay that has the ability to assign paternity to progeny resulting from mob mating. A likelihood based approach to infer paternity was used where sires with the highest LOD score (log of the ratio of the likelihood given parentage to likelihood given non-parentage) are assigned. An 84 "parentage SNP panel" was developed that assigned, on average, 99% of progeny to a sire in a problem where there were 3,000 progeny from 120 mob mated sires that included numerous half sib sires. In only 6% of those cases was there another sire with at least a 0.02 probability of paternity. Furthermore dam information (either recorded, or by genotyping possible dams) was absent, highlighting the SNP test's suitability for paternity testing. Utilization of this parentage SNP assay will allow implementation of progeny testing into large commercial farms where the improved accuracy of sire assignment and genetic evaluations will increase genetic gain in the sheep industry.

AB Major issues related to meat in our modern society are its authenticity and traceability. Meat consumers are facing problems related to addition of low value meat to high quality meat. The current study was designed to explore the potential of analytical method for the rapid detection and identification of meat. Meat of four species (beef, pork, chicken and turkey) were collected for the chemical (moisture content, ash content, crude fat and crude protein), quality (pH, color and drip loss) and spectral analysis through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Pork meat showed highest crude protein (22.20%) and crude fat contents (5.85%). Highest pH (6.14) and drip loss (1.84%) was seen in turkey meat and pork meat, respectively. Spectral data collected from FT-IR spectroscopy was analyzed through principle component analysis and partial least square regression model. The FT-IR spectra obtained after absorption in infrared region explained that all the meat samples were different based on their OH, CH and CH2 stretching in bonds. The near infrared region around 2300-1400 cm -1 had maximum spectral information required for the discriminant investigations based on the pigments contained in different species of meat to the physicochemical characteristics (moisture, intramuscular fats and fatty acids). Coefficients of determination for calibration ((RC)-C-2) and validation ((RV)-V-2), root mean square errors of calibration (RMSEC) and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) for moisture, crude protein, crude fat, ash, pH, drip loss and color L*, a*, b* of different meat samples were measured. The color value b* developed strong prediction with (RC)-C-2 = 0.941 and (RV)-V-2= 0.872.

AB Improving supply chain sustainability is an essential part of achieving the UN's sustainable goals. Digitalization, such as blockchain technology, shows the potential to reshape supply chain management. Using distributed ledger technology, the blockchain platform provides a digital system and database to record the transactions along the supply chain. This decentralized database of transactions brings transparency, reliability, traceability, and efficiency to the supply chain management. This paper focuses on such novel blockchain-based supply chain management and its sustainability performances in the areas of environmental protection, social equity, and governance efficiency. Using a systematic literature review and two case studies, we evaluate whether the three sustainability indicators can be improved indirectly along supply chains based on blockchain technology. Our study shows that blockchain technology has the potential to improve supply chain sustainability performance, and we expect blockchain technology to rise in popularity in supply chain management.

AB Chinese jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) is an economically important fruit tree that is highly adapted to marginal crop lands and can be grown under a very broad range of climate conditions. Jujube fruits produced from several traditional cultivars in Ningxia, China have enjoyed a premium market price due to their unique flavor and quality attributes. One problem with the high-end jujube market is the adulteration of premium cultivars. The accurate identification of the genetic identity of single jujube fruits is essential for cultivar traceability and authentication. The multi-locus SNP barcoding approach offers an effective solution for cultivar authentication of jujube fruits. To identify variant SNP sequences a nanofluidic array approach was used to test the efficacy of this method with DNA extracted from the fruit pulp of eight jujube cultivars from Ningxia, China. The SNP marker profiles identified the genetic identity of each fruit unambiguously based on multilocus matching and ordination analysis. Results for repeated sampling of multiple fruits from the same tree (using independent DNA extractions) showed a high level of concordance, which demonstrated the reliability of SNP based genotyping platform. This method can handle 100 s to 1000 s of samples per day (based on the platform used). It is robust and cost-effective and has a high potential for its practical application in the jujube industry. The developed method and protocol can be readily applied for botanical authentication of other stone fruits in general.

AB Increasing interest in the acquisition of biotic and abiotic resources from within the deep sea (e.g., fisheries, oil-gas extraction, and mining) urgently imposes the development of novel monitoring technologies, beyond the traditional vessel-assisted, time-consuming, high-cost sampling surveys. The implementation of permanent networks of seabed and water-column-cabled (fixed) and docked mobile platforms is presently enforced, to cooperatively measure biological features and environmental (physicochemical) parameters. Video and acoustic (i.e., optoacoustic) imaging are becoming central approaches for studying benthic fauna (e.g., quantifying species presence, behavior, and trophic interactions) in a remote, continuous, and prolonged fashion. Imaging is also being complemented by in situ environmental-DNA sequencing technologies, allowing the traceability of a wide range of organisms (including prokaryotes) beyond the reach of optoacoustic tools. Here, we describe the different fixed and mobile platforms of those benthic and pelagic monitoring networks, proposing at the same time an innovative roadmap for the automated computing of hierarchical ecological information on deep-sea ecosystems (i.e., from single species; abundance and life traits to community composition, and overall biodiversity).

AB Social networks have become increasingly popular lately, being a complementary method of expression and communication. With the adoption of quarantine and social distancing imposed by the authorities as measures to limit the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, society has used the opportunity offered by digital technology to continue its concern related to the protection and conservation of the environment, especially the forest. The purpose of this study was to highlight the public interest regarding the forests in the context of COVID-19, especially the extent to which public opinion expressed on social networks has determined public forest management policies. The results revealed a major interest in preserving biodiversity and forestry, in reducing legal logging and stopping illegal logging, and monitoring of timber shipments as measures to combat illegal logging. During the analyzed period (i.e., 1 February 2020 to 31 July 2020), several legislative acts were adopted that overlap with the requests and needs identified by environmental organizations, acts that address the issue of illegal logging, conservation, and protection of the forest, monitoring the traceability of wood. The legislation adopted in the analyzed timeframe and shortly after responded to several major topics related to the licensing and withdrawal of the logging license for illegal logging, amending the legislation for the conservation of biodiversity and the classification of areas with virgin forests as strictly protected forests. An IT system has also been implemented by the government environmental authority that allows the supervision of timber transport, offering the possibility of active involvement of civil society.

AB Techniques to evaluate the nutritional state of the crop include techniques for determination of nutrient parameters in the soil solution. A nondestructive method that allows taking of samples along the crop and obtaining the real soil solution without dilution is the suction cup, although some problems exist, including the limited sample size and possible contamination. In this work the porous cup was characterized from the chemical point of view, identifying the crystalline structures that constitute it, with x-ray fluorescence, dispersion of the wavelengths, use of certified reference patterns that guarantee the traceability of the measurements, and (from the physical point of view) determination of the total porosity and the pore-size distribution by means of the mercury intrusion technique. The design of the suction cups were also studied to obtain a robust sampler that is easy to handle, affordably priced, and able to obtain an adequate size of sample for use in commercial horticultural greenhouses. This method of measuring water and salt content of the root environment has potential applications in the greenhouse production of potted plants. Measurements obtained with this method may lead to new information on nutrient uptake by plants and the development of new strategies for managing fertility and irrigation of horticultural crops.

AB Low-yielding early-spring (ES) Longjing tea is popular with Chinese consumers and commands a high price due to its scarcity, but it has a heightened risk of substitution with lower value tea products from later harvest periods due to similarities in appearance. In this study, tea samples from different harvest periods were analyzed using stable isotope analyses (613C, 615N, 62H, and 618O) to distinguish effects from different tea drying processes, leaf maturity and harvest period. Our results showed there were no significant differences among all stable isotopes for different tea drying processes (p 0.05). 613C values showed little difference among different maturity tea leaves over the entire spring period (p > 0.05). 615N values of mature leaves were found to be 0.4 parts per thousand higher than young leaves in early spring. 62H and 618O values of different maturity leaves had different fractionation ratios (RM/Y) of 1.17 and 1.14 in early spring and late spring, respectively (p < 0.05). Generally, tea stable isotopes showed seasonal enrichment in early spring, then depletion in late spring. 618O values were significantly correlated to air humidity, light intensity and precipitation (0.53 < r < 0.92), and 613C and 62H values were negatively correlated with air temperature and air humility, respectively (0.57 < r < 0.74). A supervised chemometric model (orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis, OPLS-DA) was used to classify the ES and late-spring (LS) Longjing tea, and the discriminant accuracy of the training set was 95 %, while the test set and blind set showed a good accuracy of 100 % and 83.3 %, respectively. Result showed that this new method was a feasible technique to protect ES Longjing tea, and also provides evidence that tea harvest periods can be predicted by using stable isotopes and chemometric analyses.

Visible/infrared spectroscopy and hyperspectral imaging techniques, as rapid and non-destructive analytical methods, have been widely utilized to trace food varieties and geographical origins. In this review, we outline recent research progress on identifying food varieties and geographical origins using visible/infrared spectroscopy and hyperspectral imaging with the help of machine learning techniques. The applications of visible, near-infrared, and mid-infrared spectroscopy as well as hyperspectral imaging techniques on crop food, beverage, fruits, nuts, meat, oil, and some other kinds of food are reviewed. Furthermore, existing challenges and prospects are discussed. In general, the existing machine learning techniques contribute to satisfactory classification results. Follow-up researches of food varieties and geographical origins traceability and development of real-time detection equipment are still in demand.

AB The hybridization of cocoa generates new varieties with the aim of opening new flavors, textures, and disease resistance. The objective of this study was to develop and validate classification models based on NIR hyperspectral imaging and chemometrics for the discrimination of five valuable cocoa bean hybrids. The chemometrics tools, PLS-DA and SVM, showed comparable results for two-class (hybrids) models, but SVM (3.8-23.1% prediction error) was superior to PLS-DA (4.4-34.4% prediction error) when all five classes (hybrids) were included in a model. PLS-DA maps showed a simple and informative way to discriminate hybrids, allowing a correct classification in 50-100% of cases. Finally, it can be concluded that the models created in this work could be a good and reliably alternative to the actual visual method for the discrimination of cocoa bean hybrids.

AB The electronic identification of sheep and goats has been obligatory in the European Union since 2010 by means of low-frequency radio-frequency identification systems. The identification of pigs and cattle is currently based on a visual ear tag, but electronic animal identification is gaining in importance. The European Union already offers the additional use of electronic identification systems for cattle in their council regulation. Besides the low-frequency radio-frequency identification, an ultra-high-frequency ear tag is a possibility for electronic animal identification. The benefits of the latter frequency band are the high range, the possibility of quasi-simultaneous reading and a high data transmission rate. First systematic laboratory tests were carried out before testing the ear tags in practice. Therefore, a dynamic test bench was built. The aim of the experiments presented in this study was to compare different ear tags under standardised conditions and select the most suitable for practical use. The influence of different parameters was tested and a standard test procedure to evaluate the quality of the transponder ear tag was developed.
   The experiments showed that neither the transponder holder material (polyvinyl chloride vs. extruded polystyrene) nor the reader settings examined (triggered read vs. presence sensing) had a significant influence on the average of readings of the different transponder types. The parameter number of rounds' (10 vs. 15 vs. 20) did not show a significant effect either. However, significant differences between speed (1.5 m s(-1), 3.0 m s(-1)), transponder orientation and the fourteen transponder types were found. The two most suitable transponder ear tags for cattle and pigs have been determined by comparison. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been working with the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements to produce Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) of interest to analysts of dietary supplements. Some of these SRMs are traditional foods including SRM 3281 Cranberry (Fruit), SRM 3282 Low-Calorie Cranberry Juice Cocktail, and SRM 3287 Blueberry (Fruit), which have been characterized for nine nutritional elements and sugars. The blueberries have also been characterized for proximates, two water-soluble vitamins, and amino acids. These new materials are intended for use in method development and validation as well as for quality assurance and traceability in the assignment of values to in-house control materials. Foods can be difficult to analyze because of matrix effects. With the addition of these three new SRMs, it is now possible to more closely match controls to matrices and analyte levels for fruit and vegetable test samples. Several nutritional elements in these three SRMs are present at lower levels than in other food-matrix SRMs.

AB The rapid development and extensive application of information and communication technologies has facilitated blended instruction, which is regarded as the "new normal" in the field of modern education and has become the focus of academic research. This study thus explored the influencing mechanism of blended instruction on students' learning effectiveness from the perspective of complementarity and conflict with the support of flow. This study collected 349 survey data from universities in Southwest China that adopted a blended instruction mode and analyzed them using the structural equation model. The results demonstrated that complementary advantages and practical conflicts in blended instruction influenced students' flow experience during the learning process. Flow experience plays an important role in blended instruction and influences positively students' cognitive, emotional, and behavioral engagement. Learning engagement impacted positively students' learning effectiveness. In addition, self-efficacy positively moderated the relationship between students' learning engagement and learning effectiveness in blended instruction. These findings contribute to related research on blended instruction. The implications and limitations of this study are discussed.

AB Although morphology is always used to distinguish wild Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) populations, whether morphology could be used to identify the pond-reared offspring of wild E. sinensis populations has remained unclear. This study was undertaken to examine the morphological difference of wild E. sinensis (G0) from the Yangtze River (YR), Huang River (HR) and Liao River (LR) as well as their pond-reared offspring (G1). The results showed that: (1) The amount of significantly different parameters of three G1 populations was evidently less than that of three G0 populations; (2) G0 and G1 individuals of each population were clearly separated by principal component analysis, furthermore, three G0 populations were clearly separated while three G1 populations were not well distinguished from each other; (3) discrimination accuracy of G1 individuals in stepwise discriminant analysis was obviously lower than that of G1 populations; (4) G0 and G1 populations were clustered into two separate clusters in the cluster analysis. In conclusion, morphological differences between wild E. sinensis populations had disappeared after one generation of artificial culture, and morphology thus probably cannot be used to distinguish the pond-reared offspring originated from three wild E. sinensis populations.

AB Automation in agriculture should improve plant health, product quality, and production efficiency. However the actual use of electronic identification tools in agriculture is limited. Therefore, I review here electronic identification applications to support plant health and production and agricultural sustainability. The major points are as follows: (1) there is a tenfold increase of literature on the application of radio frequency identification in agriculture from 2000-2004 to 2005-2009. (2) Development of quick response code and radio frequency identification solutions are improving automated systems. (3) There is a major advancement in associating thermal sensors to electronic tags to preserve food quality and to manage temperature-controlled supply chain. Whereas tests with biosensors used for biological or chemical alerts are limited. (4) Agrochemical tagging, using radio frequency identification tags, improve plant health management and environmental monitoring. (5) While phytosanitary certifications are mandatory in high-cost cultivation systems and a need for risk management may promote radiofrequency identification (RFID) systems, the lack of specific economic analyses may discourage farmers and investors.

AB Ancient apple cultivars usually have higher nutraceutical value than commercial ones, but in most cases their variability in pomological traits does not allow us to discriminate among them. Fruit of two Tuscany ancient apple cultivars, Casciana' and Rotella', picked from eight different orchards (four for each cultivar) were analyzed for their pomological traits, organoleptic qualities, polyphenolic profile and antiradical activity. The effectiveness of a polyphenol-based cluster analysis was compared to molecular markers (internal transcribed spacers, ITS1 and ITS2) to unequivocally discern the two apples. Casciana' and Rotella' fruit had a higher nutraceutical value than some commercial cultivars, in terms of phenolic abundance, profile and total antiradical activity. Although pedo-climatic conditions of different orchards influenced the phenolic profile of both apples, the polyphenolic discriminant analysis clearly separated the two cultivars, principally due to higher amounts of procyanidin B2, procyanidin B3 and p-coumaroylquinic acid in Casciana' than in Rotella' fruit. These three polyphenols can be used proficiently as biochemical markers for distinguishing the two apples when pomological traits cannot. Conversely, ITS1 and ITS2 polymorphism did not allow us to distinguish Casciana' from Rotella' fruit. Overall, the use of polyphenolic fingerprint might represent a valid tool to ensure the traceability of products with a high economic value.

AB Ecosystem service research covers a challenging socio-ecological complexity and simultaneously copes with a high policy demand for decision support in sustainable resource management. This stimulates proliferation of pragmatic modeling techniques, such as the matrix model: ecosystem service supply is modeled using expert estimations per land use or land cover class. The matrix models popularity proves its main strengths (efficient, fast, accessible and adaptable), but also entails risks for scientific credibility and legitimacy of its results and ecosystem service assessments in general. Some of the main methodological critiques on the matrix model can be addressed especially by including measures of confidence, traceability, reliability, consistency and validity. This review presents recommendations and encourages these to become standard practise in future applications of the matrix model and related techniques.
   Additionally, we argue that an extended matrix model could provide more than only scientifically sound and politically legitimate results. It could serve as a tool to improve cooperation between natural and social sciences, experts, stakeholders and decision makers: collaborative development of the matrix model contributes to transdisciplinary ecosystem service research aimed at effective implementation and action.

AB Premise of the study: Pinus pinea is one of the few widespread plant species that are also genetically depauperate. It is also an important commercial species with high market value seeds. A deeper knowledge of the existing population genetic variation was needed.
   Methods and Results: Twelve nuclear microsatellites were isolated from genomic and cDNA sequences and screened for variability in 729 individuals from 33 natural populations. Low level of genetic variability was confirmed with average expected heterozygosity of 0.11. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium expectations were not met in only similar to 10% of the possible locus/population combinations. All loci were in linkage equilibrium, and the frequency of null alleles was very low (<= 1% in 332 out of 396 locus/population combinations). Nine out of the 12 microsatellites were successfully transferred to P. halepensis.
   Conclusions: Despite low polymorphism, these new markers will be useful to resolve population structure and hold potential for seed origin identification and traceability.

AB In many countries, genetically modified organisms (GMO)legislations have been established in order to guarantee the traceability of food/feed products on the market and to protect the consumer freedom of choice. Therefore, several GMO detection strategies, mainly based on DNA, have been developed to implement these legislations. Due to its numerous advantages, the quantitative PCR (qPCR) is the method of choice for the enforcement laboratories in GMO routine analysis. However, given the increasing number and diversity of GMO developed and put on the market around the world, some technical hurdles could be encountered with the qPCR technology, mainly owing to its inherent properties. To address these challenges, alternative GMO detection methods have been developed, allowing faster detections of single GM target (e.g., loop-mediated isothermal amplification), simultaneous detections of multiple GM targets (e.g., PCR capillary gel electrophoresis, microarray, and Luminex), more accurate quantification of GM targets (e.g., digital PCR), or characterization of partially known (e.g., DNA walking and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)) or unknown (e.g., NGS) GMO. The benefits and drawbacks of these methods are discussed in this review.

AB This study aimed to compare the egg laying performance of the four varieties (white, franciscan, black, and partridge) of a Spanish endangered Utrerana hen breed. A flock of 60 Utrerana hens (15 hen/variety) were individually housed to enable daily egg traceability. Compartmental, Gamma, linear hyperbolic, logistic curvilinear, McNally, Narushin-Takma, and quadratic logarithmic nonlinear regression functions were fitted. Goodness-of-fit (coefficient of determination (R-2)) and flexibility criteria (mean squared error (MSE), Akaike information criteria (AIC), corrected Akaike information criteria (AICc), Bayesian information criteria (BIC)) were evaluated to identify the best-fitting function to model for egg production curve. Best-fitting values were reported by the six-parameter Narushin-Takma model for white (R-2 = 0.828), franciscan (R-2 = 0.888), and black (R-2 = 0.899) varieties. By contrast, quadratic logarithmic was reported to be the best-fitting model for partridge Utrerana hen egg production curve (R-2 = 0.917). The characterization of the laying cycle of endangered avian breeds varieties permits tailoring productive strategies which may ensure animal welfare at the same that they boost economic potentialities, enabling the productive model to better simultaneously fulfill animal needs and human demands. As a result, breed diversity may act as the motor element to improve economic profitability, but in turn may also ensure the conservation of the local genetic resources from which desirable products, such as the egg, are obtained.

AB Quick, accurate and reliable technique for discrimination of cocoa beans according to geographical origin is essential for quality control and traceability management. This current study presents the application of Near Infrared Spectroscopy technique and multivariate classification for the differentiation of Ghana cocoa beans. A total of 194 cocoa bean samples from seven cocoa growing regions were used. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to extract relevant information from the spectral data and this gave visible cluster trends. The performance of four multivariate classification methods: Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Back propagation artificial neural network (BPANN) and Support vector machine (SVM) were compared. The performances of the models were optimized by cross validation. The results revealed that; SVM model was superior to all the mathematical methods with a discrimination rate of 100% in both the training and prediction set after preprocessing with Mean centering (MC). BPANN had a discrimination rate of 99.23% for the training set and 96.88% for prediction set. While LDA model had 96.15% and 90.63% for the training and prediction sets respectively. KNN model had 75.01% for the training set and 72.31% for prediction set. The non-linear classification methods used were superior to the linear ones. Generally, the results revealed that NIR Spectroscopy coupled with SVM model could be used successfully to discriminate cocoa beans according to their geographical origins for effective quality assurance.

AB A Multiple Headspace Solid-Phase Microextraction (MHS-SPME) method was optimized for the isolation and quantification of volatile compounds from samples of flour and pasta, obtained from buckwheat and Khorasan wheat. In a second step, SPME extracts were analyzed by means of a Multidimensional Gas Chromatographic (MDGC) system, operated in both "stand-by" and "heart-cutting" modes. The first dimension was equipped with a non polar column and an FID detector; the second dimension was provided with a modified beta-cyclodextrin stationary phase and mass spectrometric detector. Such instrumental apparatus, under accurately optimized conditions, allowed to obtain detailed fingerprints with the definition of markers of quality and traceability among the various samples investigated. Some volatiles (i.e. 3,4-hexanedione, hexanal, 1-octen-3-ol, 2-pentylfuran, germacrene D) were commonly present in all the samples, some others (i.e. undecanal, gamma-nonalactone, neryl acetone) only in one cereal species. In addition, the determination of enantiomeric ratios of optically active volatiles was successfully carried out, with the separation of 14 enantiomer pairs. Fifty % of chiral components showed an almost racemic composition, while the remaining pairs evidenced a predominance of the levorotatory enantiomer. Quantification of key volatiles was performed through MHS-SPME, a calibration methodology specifically developed for headspace analysis, which allowed to determine 3,4-hexanedione (2.2.10(-3) g/kg), 2-pentylfuran (3.4.10(-3) g/kg) and germacrene D (4.2.10(-3) g/kg), as major compounds.

AB Panyong Congou black tea (PCT) is one of the most representative and historically famous Congou black teas in China and has been gaining more and more attention for its beneficial health properties. Currently, four grades of PCT are available, based on the raw leaf materials and consumer palatability. The chemical profiles distinguishing different grades of PCT are yet to be defined, nor has the relationship with grade been evaluated. In the present study, chemometric analysis showed that epigallocatechin (EGC), catechin (C), polyphenols, gallic acid (GA), and free amino acids are grade related bio-markers of PCT. These compounds are associated with the sweet and mellow aftertaste of PCT. A total of 34 volatile components were identified, of which the three component types with the highest relative percentages were alcohols (51.34-52.51%), ketones (27.31-30.28%), and aldehydes (12.70-13.18%). Additionally, our results revealed that sweet floral and fruity aromas were positively correlated with six volatile organic compounds (VOCs), 1-pentanol, propyl hexanoate, linalool, cyclohexanone, hexanal, and 2,5-dimethylpyrazine. Clear discrimination was achieved using orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The findings provide vital information on the characteristic flavor of each grade of PCT.

TI An Efficient and Secure Anonymous Authentication Scheme for VANETs Based

AB Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have stimulated interests in both academic and industry settings. Once deployed, they would bring a new driving experience to drivers. However, in an open-access environment, privacy is one of the greatest challenges, as drivers want to keep their personal information protected. Therefore, many authentication protocols have been proposed as solutions to the privacy issue. In most of the existing protocols, to prevent the revoked entity from generating a valid authentication information, the verifiers must frequently download the revocation list from one or more remote authorities to keep the list up-to-date, which greatly increases the workload of the remote authority. In this paper, to cope with such challenging concerns, based on the idea of group signatures, we propose a novel authentication protocol scheme by using the complete sub-tree method to achieve membership revocation, which ensures forward security. In our scheme, the verifiers can verify the authentication information by getting the latest epoch t without having to obtain the latest revocation list. In the aspect of security, the proposed protocol is featured with forward security, CCA2-anonymity, unforgeability, non-frameability, and traceability. In addition, our scheme adopts a decentralized group model, so that the whole domain of VANETs is divided into sub-Rregions and any vehicle has to update its non-revoked token periodically from the regional group manager who manages the region where the vehicle stays.

AB In this study our aim was to value the benefits of rapid effective trace-back capability-based on a livestock identification system - in the event of a foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak. We simulated an FMD outbreak in the Texas High Plains, an area of high livestock concentration, beginning in a large feedlot. Disease spread was simulated under different time dependent animal tracing scenarios. In the specific scenario modeled (incursion of FMD within a large feedlot, detection within 14 days and 90% effective tracing), simulation suggested that control costs of the outbreak significantly increase if tracing does not occur until day 10 as compared to the baseline of tracing on day 2. In addition, control costs are significantly increased if effectiveness were to drop to 30% as compared to the baseline of 90%. Results suggest potential benefits from rapid effective tracing in terms of reducing government control costs; however, a variety of other scenarios need to be explored before determining in which situations rapid effective trace-back capability is beneficial.

ID CHALLENGES
AB Despite the steady export of Ukrainian grain growth, the net profit from its sales does not increase, and most times, even falls. That is why it became necessary to find out the reasons for the current situation and find ways out of it. The most common method for solving such problems in the modern world is the implementation 61 blockchain and related technologies (smart contracts, cryptocurrencies, etc.). This article is devoted to studying the economic need for the use of blockchain technologies to monitor grain for export in Ukraine and the analysis of foreign experience blockchain implementation to agricultural supply chains to adapt the best practices to Ukrainian realities. As a result of a theoretical study, the article identified problems in Ukrainian grain export, analyzed the results of using blockchain to solve similar problems in foreign countries, and also identified ways to use world experience in this area. In addition, the authors offered practical recommendations for changing and complementing the existing technological and logistic stages of grain export in Ukraine. It was also found that blockchain technologies, because of their properties such as decentralized control, security, traceability, and control of transactions, could solve most of the problems that arise in the grain supply chain from grower to end consumer. The authors have proposed a generalized multilayer system that includes a "Data input layer", a "Data store layer", and a "User's layer", which most fully considers the peculiarities of agriculture in Ukraine. However, the question of these technologies introducing cost and the economic feasibility of their use for farms of various sizes remains is still unclear, and will be considered by the authors in their following works.

AB Rationale: isotope reference materials are essential to enable reliable and comparable isotope data across multiple laboratories. Although many reference materials already exist, the best reference materials should mimic the unknown samples, so new reference materials continue to evolve with the development of isotope research in new product areas.
   Methods: Two defatted beef reference materials, CAAS-1801 and CAAS-1802, with substantially different delta C-13 values (due to difference in dietary intake), have been prepared as reference materials for stable C and N isotope analysis of meat tissue. Homogeneity, and short- and long-term stability tests of these reference materials have been performed. The delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of both materials were measured for two-point isotopic normalization against international reference materials by elemental analyzer/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (EA/IRMS). A total of nine international laboratories were selected for the joint evaluation. Cochran statistical analysis yielded the values reported here.
   Results: The defatted beef reference material CAAS-1801 from Heilongjiang province has a delta C-13 value of -13.58 +/- 0.56% relative to VPDB and a delta N-15 value of 4.23 +/- 0.56% relative to N-2 in air. The defatted beef reference material CAAS-1802 from Sichuan province has a delta C-13 value of -25.03 +/- 0.45% and a delta N-15 value of 4.36 +/- 0.69%.
   Conclusions: The two defatted beef reference materials were found to be isotopically stable across a range of ambient temperatures, and to have low volatility and toxicity, which enables them to be useful as stable isotope reference materials in the field of authentication and traceability of meat.

AB The only native species of the Castanea genus in Europe is Castanea sativa Mill., a widespread and important multipurpose tree species in the Mediterranean area that provides fruit, wood and shelter for hives. With the aim of expanding the knowledge of the genetic variability of the chestnut species (wild trees and varieties) and promoting the traceability of local products, an analysis based on 16 SSRs was carried out on 630 single trees from Italy and Spain. 319 unique genotypes were identified. A Bayesian approach combined with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation method revealed the existence of two genetically distinct groups of chestnuts: Cluster 1 (Spain) and Cluster 2 (Italy), with a clear separation between the cultivars from (northern and southern) Spain and from Italy. The results also confirmed a common genetic structure between chestnut populations from southern Spain and southern Italy, which is the result of historical events and long-term human impact. The results showed no genetic differentiation between chestnut cultivars (grafted trees) and wild chestnut trees, probably as a consequence of the proximity of orchards and natural populations, which resulted in a gene flow between them.

AB DNA barcodes (i.e. cytochrome c oxidase subunit I or COI in the mitochondrial genome) obtained from fourteen (14) domesticated duck breeds, strains, and hybrids (Anatidae) in the Philippines were analyzed using the Neighbour-Joining method based on Kimura 2-parameter model in MEGA5. Based on 642 COI positions, overall genetic diversity was 14.6%. Average genetic variation within duck groups was highest among introduced mallard breeds (17.6%), intermediate among hybrid ducks (16.2%), and lowest among Philippine mallard strains (15.4%). Our analyses indicated that DNA barcodes can be effective to identify and differentiate duck breeds, strains, and hybrids. Closer genetic distance between Laguna "mule" duck with Pekin and Philippine mallard strains was observed, than with Muscovy DNA barcoding also provided insights into evolutionary processes in the development of egg-type mallard strains and their relationships with introduced mallard breeds. COI sequences should be determined from more duck breeds, strains, and hybrids to catalogue domesticated duck biodiversity and benefit breed traceability as well as breed definition for conservation issues. Genetic diversity information from DNA barcodes in addition to phenotypic performance standards and pedigree records may be used to set conservation and improvement priorities and determine which breed or strain needing more detailed phylogenetic analysis.

AB The unambiguous application of fungal names is important to communicate scientific findings. Names are critical for (clinical) diagnostics, legal compliance, and regulatory controls, such as biosafety, food security, quarantine regulations, and industrial applications. Consequently, the stability of the taxonomic system and the traceability of nomenclatural changes is crucial for a broad range of users and taxonomists. The unambiguous application of names is assured by the preservation of nomenclatural history and the physical organisms representing a name. Fungi are extremely diverse in terms of ecology, lifestyle, and methods of study. Predominantly unicellular fungi known as yeasts are usually investigated as living cultures. Methods to characterize yeasts include physiological (growth) tests and experiments to induce a sexual morph; both methods require viable cultures. Thus, the preservation and availability of viable reference cultures are important, and cultures representing reference material are cited in species descriptions. Historical surveys revealed drawbacks and inconsistencies between past practices and modern requirements as stated in the International Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi, and Plants (ICNafp). Improper typification of yeasts is a common problem, resulting in a large number invalid yeast species names. With this opinion letter, we address the problem that culturable microorganisms, notably some fungi and algae, require specific provisions under the ICNafp. We use yeasts as a prominent example of fungi known from cultures. But viable type material is important not only for yeasts, but also for other cultivable Fungi that are characterized by particular morphological structures (a specific type of spores), growth properties, and secondary metabolites. We summarize potential proposals which, in our opinion, will improve the stability of fungal names, in particular by protecting those names for which the reference material can be traced back to the original isolate.

AB Diatoms are used routinely to assess pollution level in rivers and lakes. Current methods are based on identification by light microscopy, which is laborious. An alternative is to identify species based on short DNA fragments and High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS). However a potential limitation is the incomplete coverage of species in reference barcode libraries. Usually these libraries are compiled by isolating cells, before culturing and sequencing them, which is tedious and often unsuccessful. Here we propose the use of rbcL sequences from environmental samples analysed by HTS. We set several criteria to ensure good sequence quality and correspondence with the target species observed in microscopy: the sequence needed to be abundant in the sample, and with no insertions nor deletions or stop codon, phylogenetic neighbour taxa had to correspond to neighbour taxonomic taxa expected from morphological observations. Four species from tropical rivers are given as examples, including one that is new to science.

AB The good agricultural practices refer to the agricultural production model which does not harm environment, human being and animals, protect the natural sources, provide the traceability, sustainability and food safety. The present study aimed to calculate the production cost, gross production value, gross profit, absolute profit and relative profit in farms which implement or do not implement good agricultural practices in citrus cultivating in Adana. The main material of this study consists of primary data obtained through survey method from 170 farms, which either implement or do not implement the good agricultural practices, in citrus cultivating in Adana. According to the findings, unit production costs are higher in farms implementing GAP. Accordingly, the relative profitability values are higher compared to the farms which implement GAP. The relative profit in GAP implementing farms involved in lemon cultivating is 1.15 while it is 1.22 in farms which do not implement GAP; and it is 1.19 in mandarin cultivating farms which do and do not implement GAP. It was found out that the citrus cultivating was profitable in both forms of cultivating. The reasons why profitability is higher in farms which do not implement GAP are productivity, sales price and additional costs of implementing GAP. In this respect, the marketing advantages should be provided for the products of good agricultural practices in order to generalize the GAP.

AB Rice is an important staple food in China, which authenticity is closely associated with nutrition and safety. It is necessary to discriminate their geographical origin with a comprehensive databank. 900 Japonica and Indica rice samples from 17 provinces were collected to analysis stable isotopes and trace elements for their origin discrimination of four regions as Middle-Lower Yangtze Plain (Y-R), northeast (N-E), southwest (S-W) and southeast (S-E). Results revealed Japonica rice was isotopically more positive than Indica rice, becoming -27.3 parts per thousand vs. -28.5 parts per thousand for delta C-13, 5.2 parts per thousand vs. 4.6 parts per thousand for delta N-15, -58.7 parts per thousand vs. -65.1 parts per thousand for delta H-2 and 20.3 parts per thousand vs. 18.1 parts per thousand for delta O-18 in Japonica vs. Indica rice, respectively. N-E rice had the most positive stable isotope values and Y-R rice had higher elemental contents. Using neural network modeling, Japonica rice from N-E and Y-R was discriminated with high accuracy of 97.2%. And Indica rice could also be geographically assigned to Y-R, S-W and S-E with the accuracy of 76.0% for blind samples. This study establishes the first comprehensive stable isotopic and elemental geographical database for Chinese rice and provides a promising discrimination method to key production regions in China.

AB The composition of virgin olive oils from three new olive cultivars, such as Arno, Tevere and Basento, has been investigated in this work. Our attention was focused on chlorophylls, carotenes, xanthophylls and other major bioactives, as well as on some analytical indices related to functionality, quality and typicality of the new products. Our analytical study showed how the new oil kinds, especially Arno oil, had an interesting qualitative-quantitative composition of the pigment fraction. Pheophytin a (within the chlorophyll subfraction) and lutein (within the carotenoid subfraction) were found to be the major natural pigments occurring in the new products. Interesting were also the concentrations of biophenols, tocopherols, and tocotrienols detected in the three new oil varieties, as well as the values of the remarkable ratio fatty acids omega(6)/fatty acids omega(3) and biophenols/polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (and those of the analytical variables endurance and susceptibility to autoxidation). The chemometric analyses showed how different multivariate methods were effective in discriminating between oil varieties. Thus, these chemometrics can effectively be used for traceability or authentication of the new products. We concluded how the three new olive cultivars can actually lead to new advances in the olive growing sector. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The common dentex (Dentex dentex (Linnaeus, 1758)) is an iconic fish in the Mediterranean diet. Due to its commercial and organoleptic importance, this sparid is highly appreciated in European markets and is often subjected to species substitution frauds. Comparative mitogenomics is a suitable approach for identifying new and effective barcode markers. This study aimed to find a molecular tag useful for unequivocally discriminating the sparid species D. dentex. The comparison of the complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences of 16 sparid species allowed us to highlight the potential of the NAD2 gene for direct identification purposes. Common dentex-specific primers were created and successfully evaluated by end-point and real-rime PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) for several fish species, achieving amplification only in the D. dentex. The method proposed in this study appears fast, simple, and inexpensive and requires affordable instrumentation. This approach provides unambiguous results for the common dentex authentication without the sequencing step. The presence/absence assay for D. dentex can be executed in a few hours of lab work. Therefore, national authorities responsible for food safety and traceability could apply and make full use of DNA-testing methods for deterring operators from false seafood declarations.

AB Geographic origin of sea cucumber is topic of interest for both consumers and producers since the prices of sea cucumber vary largely according to their geographic origins. It is currently important that a scientific technique should be developed for determining geographic origin as a mean to detect fraudulent labeling. We have therefore developed a technique to classify the geographic origin of sea cucumber based on elemental analysis combined with the statistical analysis. In this study, a total of 39 elements contents of sea cucumber from five major production regions in China were determined to evaluate their applicability in the origin traceability of sea cucumber. Pattern recognition techniques including principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminate analysis (LDA) were applied to evaluate their performance in terms of classification or predictive ability. Thirty six elements in sea cucumber samples of different regions showed significant differences (p < 0.05), which proved that the elemental composition was an effective tool for distinguishing different origins of sea cucumber. Classification of sea cucumber using PCA did not give satisfactory results. The LDA gave an overall correct classification rate of 94.1% and cross-validation rate of 88.2%. These results demonstrated the usefulness of multi-element fingerprints as indicators for authenticating the geographical origin of sea cucumber in China.

AB Background: Salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis are among the most frequently reported foodborne diseases worldwide. Commercial chicken meat has been identified as one of the most important food vehicles for Salmonella and Campylobacter infection. Increased poultry consumption has forced producers to explore methods for increasing their production output, while maintaining the affordability and safety of their products. While the forecast benefits of nanotechnology have yet to be fully realised, it has potential application at many points along the food production chain and offers the opportunity to meet these challenges.
   Scope and approach: The commercial poultry processing environment plays a significant role in reducing foodborne pathogens and spoilage organisms from poultry products prior to being supplied to consumers. This review discusses the potential opportunities and challenges for adopting nano-enabled technologies in the poultry industry, with respect to applications in microbiological food safety and quality assurance in the processing plant.
   Key findings and conclusions: Several possibilities exist to exploit the benefits of nanotechnologies in the poultry processing plant to enhance the microbiological safety and quality of products. Those applications include the adoption of nano-enabled disinfectants, surface biocides, protective clothing, air and water filters, packaging, biosensors and rapid detection methods for contaminants, and technologies that assure the authenticity and traceability of products. Although the fate and potential toxicity of nanomaterials are not fully understood at this time and scientific risk assessments are required, it is evident that there have been significant advances in the application of novel nanotechnologies in the food industry.

AB The nutritional requirements can be met, and carcass quality can be achieved by using concentrate supplementation in the diets of grazing lambs. This study evaluated the effects of different concentrate supplementation rates (0 %, 1.5 %, and 3 % of body weight) and tropical pastures (Panicum maximum cv. 'Aruana' and Brachiaria brizantha cv. 'Marandu') on lamb carcass traits. Thirty-six male Suffolk lambs, with an initial body weight of 22.54 +/- 2.72 kg, were evaluated in a 3 x 2 factorial experimental design. The concentrate used consisted of milled soybean, maize, and oat grains. The pasture species affected empty body weight and commercial cuts. The use of concentrate supplementation affected carcass weight, yield, indexes, and commercial cuts. Also, the use of concentrate supplementation improved the weight of muscle and fat content. Based on discriminant analysis it is possible to identify the rearing systems, when all variables where used, or the level of concentrate supplementation when variables of weight were used. Carcasses of animals on grass-only diets were different and easier to discriminate. The use of concentrate supplementation on rearing lambs improves the quality of carcass traits. The period of finishing can be shorted with supplementation of 3 % of body weigh in Aruana and Marandu grass. The discriminant analysis can identify the differences between rearing systems based on all carcass traits. This analysis can be used to develop carcass traceability systems.

AB There are increasing concerns by consumers regarding agricultural product traceability and authenticity. Oxygen isotope composition (delta(18)o) has been used in this context based on the relationship between delta(18)o of animal, products and annual precipitation. However, in dairy products this relationship is affected by the seasonality of delta(18)o in milk water which in turn depends on the feeding system used. We measured 608 milk samples from 28 farms with various feeding strategies in southern Germany throughout the year, investigating the influences of ambient conditions, drinking water source, and feeding strategies on seasonal variation of delta(18)o in milk water (delta(milk)). The mechanistic Munich-Kohn model reflecting these influences predicted the seasonal and farm-specific variation of delta(milk) well. The relationship between delta(18)o of precipitation and delta(milk) varied in different feeding strategies. The interplay of ambient conditions and feeding strategy on delta(milk) should thus be carefully considered when identifying the origin of milk.

AB With the globalization of food trade, it's traceability and genuineness becomes increasingly more difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to develop analytical tools to define the authenticity and genuineness of food-derived products. In the current work, headspace solid-phase microextraction followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC-MS) combined with chemometric tools was used to establish the volatile fingerprint of apple ciders produced in different geographical regions of Madeira Island, in order to define their typicity and to identify putative geographical markers. A total of 143 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) belonging to different chemical families have been identified, of which 28 were found in all apple ciders independently of geographical region. Esters, terpenic and furanic compounds presented on average a higher contribution for the total volatile fingerprint in cider produced in northern region of the Island, whereas alcohols, acids, volatile phenols, carbonyl compounds and lactones in cider from southern region. Considering the relative areas of the VOCs, 43 revealed statistically significant differences (p < 0.001) between geographical regions, and 11 between northern and southern regions. A clear differentiation among cider-producing regions was observed on the developed partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model. Two alcohols (1-hexanol, 1-octanol), 6 esters (methyl acetate, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol acetate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl nonanote, ethyl octanoate, isoamyl octanoate) and 1 terpenic compound (limonene), can be considered putative geographic markers due to their discriminatory ability. The results obtained recognize the specific and typical geographical characteristics of the cider, which will allow the forthcoming guarantee for the construction of a sustainable platform for the establishment of the authenticity and typicality of the regional cider.

AB BACKGROUND In the present study a metabolomics-based approach was used to discriminate among different hazelnut cultivars and to trace their geographical origins. Ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI/QTOF-MS) was used to profile phenolic and sterolic compounds. RESULTS Compounds were identified against an in-house database using accurate monoisotopic mass and isotopic patterns. The screening approach was designed to discern 15 hazelnut cultivars and to discriminate among the geographical origins of six cultivars from the four main growing regions (Chile, Georgia, Italy, and Turkey). This approach allowed more than 1000 polyphenols and sterols to be annotated. The metabolomics data were elaborated with both unsupervised (hierarchical clustering) and supervised (orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis, OPLS-DA) statistics. These multivariate statistical tools allowed hazelnut samples to be discriminated, considering both 'cultivar type' and 'geographical origin'. Flavonoids (anthocyanins, flavanols and flavonols - VIP scores 1.34-1.49), phenolic acids (mainly hydroxycinnamics - VIP scores 1.35-1.55) together with cholesterol, ergosterol, and stigmasterol derivatives (VIP scores 1.34-1.49) were the best markers to discriminate samples according to geographical origin. CONCLUSIONS This work illustrates the potential of untargeted profiling of phenolics and sterols based on UHPLC-ESI/QTOF mass spectrometry to discriminate hazelnut and support authenticity and origin.

AB The effect of various slaughtering age options on the quality characteristics of subcutaneous backfat layers from Iberian x Duroc crossbred pigs under Montanera system was assessed. Three batches (IBxD16, IBxD14 and IBxD12) were established to start the Montanera with 14, 12 and 10 months of age and similar weight. After slaughter at 16,14 and 12 months respectively, a piece of backfat was taken from each animal, and subsequently separated into outer, inner and subinner layers, and quality traits were performed in each one separately. Higher C18:1 n-9, MUFA, alpha- and gamma-tocopherol were found in animals slaughtered with 16 months in the subinner backfat, which might be suitable to Iberian slaughtering age traceability. Lightness and redness varied with the age of the animal, for which showed an inverse pattern, and backfat layer, while yellowness only according to the latter.

AB Radix Astragali (RA), the root of Astragalus membranaceus var. mongholicus (Bunge) P.K. Hsiao, known as "Huangqi" in Chinese, has been used as a traditional herbal medicine or food in China for more than 2,000 years and is now consumed globally. Unfortunately, the increasing demand for RA has led to the overexploitation of its wild stock, as well as quality problems, including adulteration and contamination. Therefore, the sustainable cultivation of RA is urgently needed. In the present research, semi-structured interviews and key informant interviews were conducted, over a 2-year period, to collect data from stakeholders in the main production areas; moreover, a targeted chemical analysis-based quality assessment strategy was applied to understand the quality of RA. Accordingly, 10 different types of value chains (VCs) were identified in RA production; meanwhile, the contents of the main active ingredients (astragaloside and calycosin-7-O-beta-D-glucoside) were analyzed by HPLC-ELSD-UV and the yield of medicinal material was demined and further analyzed using k-means clustering analysis. The results show that the tight relationship between quality of the RA and stakeholders' revenues among the VCs, which reflects a more general trend in the production system. Over the past few decades, vertical coordination has emerged increasingly in VCs of RA, which leads to a more coherent traceability system and rigorous regulations in the supply chains. Daodi herbs can be considered to be a standard that is distinctive with good quality characteristics that emphasize the origins of the medicinal plants. We find that the suitability of geographical areas and vertical integration can improve the VCs of RA, which further contributes to its quality control, as well as its sustainable production.

AB To avoid false declarations of geographic and botanical honey origin, traceability should be based on analytical data, which could then be processed by multivariate statistical methods. Obtaining this data, however, is costly and time consuming. Thus, it would be more convenient to acquire this information from routine trials, for example from the analysis for determination of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) concentration in honey. The availability of a procedure of this kind in Uruguay would be useful in discriminating between honeys from grasslands to that from eucalyptus, the two main floral sources for commercial production. To this effect, honey samples (47 from pastures and 42 from eucalypts) were analyzed for delta C-13 in both honey and its protein fraction. We identified a logistic regression model that allowed us to correctly assign 90% of the training samples, using delta C-13 data of honey, protein fraction, and the isotopic index as variables. This model was then validated, obtaining 100% correct allocation for honeys from pasture and 90% for honeys from eucalyptus. Moreover, we found that this information could also be used to establish adulteration with HFCS based on a local stricter cut-off limit than that of -1.0 parts per thousand of the international index.

AB The beer production chain includes some crucial steps regarding processing, delivery, service, and consumption that can benefit from the implementation of IoT (Internet of Things) based technologies. Large breweries implemented the use of sensors and digitization before smaller ones among which are craft breweries. Internet of Beer (IoB) technologies are becoming accessible to mid and small sized brewing companies. Therefore, the objective of this work is to review mainly low-cost IoB smart technologies that can be implemented from the mash to the final product and its service, to improve the brewing production, control, delivery, and final quality increasing profitability. The reviewed applications were retrieved both from the scientific databases and from the web. The work is structured in three macro areas such as beer processing, product logistics and traceability, and service. The results show a future trend characterized by a very fast increase in the use of IoB (also open source) systems to drive efficiency, productivity, quality, and safety. This will be done by real-time monitoring and a data-driven decision support system (DSS). Crucial aspects needing further investigation are data ownership and data standardization. The access price of IoB devices and software is destined for a significant decrease while their diversification on the market will grow leading to a massive future implementation within all the production levels.

AB Modem technologies have enabled approaches to estimate freshness of perishable products during production and distribution. This allows supply chains to apply more advanced decision support systems in order to further reduce the loss of perishable products. In this paper we focus on the postharvest scheduling of starch potatoes. In particular we propose a quality-aware scheduling method that can be used in a decision support system for starch potato postharvest operations. Considering the quality of stored potatoes in real-time, the method determines when and how many potatoes should be harvested, sent for starch production, or stored. A centralized and a distributed control strategy are developed, with the aim of minimizing total starch loss in dynamic environments. Simulation experiments illustrate how the proposed approaches deal with disturbances, and that the total starch loss can be reduced when real-time quality information of potatoes is taken into account.

AB As populations diverge, genomic regions associated with adaptation display elevated differentiation. These genomic islands of adaptive divergence can inform conservation efforts in exploited species, by refining the delineation of management units, and providing genomic tools for more precise and effective population monitoring and the successful assignment of individuals and products. We explored heterogeneity in genomic divergence and its impact on the resolution of spatial population structure in exploited populations of Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, using genome wide expressed sequence derived single nucleotide polymorphisms in 466 individuals sampled across the range. Outlier tests identified elevated divergence at 5.2% of SNPs, consistent with directional selection in one-third of linkage groups. Genomic regions of elevated divergence ranged in size from a single position to several cM. Structuring at neutral loci was associated with geographic features, whereas outlier SNPs revealed genetic discontinuities in both the eastern and western Atlantic. This fine-scale geographic differentiation enhanced assignment to region of origin, and through the identification of adaptive diversity, fundamentally changes how these populations should be conserved. This work demonstrates the utility of genome scans for adaptive divergence in the delineation of stock structure, the traceability of individuals and products, and ultimately a role for population genomics in fisheries conservation.

AB In crop growth management, phenotypic traits are an important basis for judging growth status. Manual measurements are labor-intensive, unstable and time-consuming. We propose an image processing pipeline to estimate multiple lettuce traits (fresh weight, dry weight, plant height, diameter, leaf area) based on the lightweight DeepLabV3 + network. Accurate and rapid segmentation of crops from backgrounds is the basis for phenotypic research. First, we propose to combine DeepLabV3 + and MobilenetV2 to realize a high-precision and fast segmentation of lettuce in complex backgrounds and illuminations. Based on the segmentation results, we extracted the morphological factors and vegetation indices. Random forest (RF), partial least squares regression (PLSR) and support vector machine were applied to predict the multiple lettuce traits and compared for optimal model selection. Results showed that DeepLabv3 + (with Mobilenetv2) has the best segmentation performance with pixel accuracy of 97.520% and 99.821%, mIoU of 88.661% and 98.517%, and segmentation speeds with 0.094 and 0.049 ms per image in dataset D3 and dataset D4. PLSR had the highest accuracy in predicting fresh weight, dry weight, diameter and leaf area, with R-2 of 0.898, 0.899, 0.931 and 0.904, respectively. RF yielded the highest accuracy in predicting plant height, with R-2 of 0.858. We proposed method for estimating phenotypic characteristics of lettuce based on deep learning has excellent performance and important application value for lettuce growth monitoring and yield estimation.

ID PATENT RIGHTS; INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; GRAVITY-EQUATION; TECHNOLOGY;

AB This paper examines how foreign intellectual property rights (IPRs) affect US bilateral exports of genetically modified crops (GMOs). We apply the structural gravity model to examine GMO trade between the United States and the countries that comprise the rest of the world. Our econometric method includes the Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood estimator. We use panel data including measures of countries' IPR regimes, plant patentability, plant variety rights, GMO regulations and asynchronous approvals of GMOs. Results show the United States tends to export fewer GMO crops to countries with strong IPR regimes, plant patentability and plant variety rights. These results are consistent with the market power effect, where the United States restricts exports to countries with strong protections to extract monopoly prices. Second, enforcement of IPRs strengthens the market power effect. Third, the market power effect is strong alongside with GMO regulations and asynchronous approvals. Fourth, the market power effect is larger for self-pollinating crops vs. hybrids. These findings are robust across a variety of specifications. However, we also find a price premium in countries with less ease of US market access, with more domestic production of GMOs, and with weak traceability requirements. These features play a stronger role than IPRs in determining price.

AB Native duck populations have lower productivity, and have not been developed as much as commercials duck breeds. However, native ducks have more importance in terms of genetic diversity and potentially valuable economic traits. For this reason, population discriminable genetic markers are needed for conservation and development of native ducks. In this study, 24 highly polymorphic microsatellite (MS) markers were investigated using commercial ducks and native East and South Asian ducks. The average polymorphic information content (PIC) value for all MS markers was 0.584, indicating high discrimination power. All populations were discriminated using 14 highly polymorphic MS markers by genetic distance and phylogenetic analysis. The results indicated that there were close genetic relationships among populations. In the structure analysis, East Asian ducks shared more haplotypes with commercial ducks than South Asian ducks, and they had more independent haplotypes than others did. These results will provide useful information for genetic diversity studies in ducks and for the development of duck traceability systems in the market.

AB Selected Ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) in combination with chemometrics was used to authenticate the geographical origin of Mediterranean virgin olive oils (VOOs) produced under geographical origin labels. In particular, 130 oil samples from six different Mediterranean regions (Kalamata (Greece); Toscana (Italy); Meknes and Tyout (Morocco); and Priego de Cordoba and Baena (Spain)) were considered. The headspace volatile fingerprints were measured by SIFT-MS in full scan with H3O+, NO+ and O-2(+) as precursor ions and the results were subjected to chemometric treatments. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used for preliminary multivariate data analysis and Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) was applied to build different models (considering the three reagent ions) to classify samples according to the country of origin and regions (within the same country). The multi-class PLS-DA models showed very good performance in terms of fitting accuracy (98.90-100%) and prediction accuracy (96.70-100% accuracy for cross validation and 97.30-100% accuracy for external validation (test set)). Considering the two-class PLS-DA models, the one for the Spanish samples showed 100% sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in calibration, cross validation and external validation; the model for Moroccan oils also showed very satisfactory results (with perfect scores for almost every parameter in all the cases).

AB Salix psammophila C. Wang et Ch. Y. Yang is an important desert shrub that is mainly distributed in northwest China, including the Mu Us sandland and Kubuqi desert. It plays a crucial role in vegetation rehabilitation and as a forestation plant. The traditional identification of its accessions based on phenotypic traits is usually unreliable. SSR (Simple Sequence Repeat) has the advantages of repeatability and codominant inheritance, and most species have had specific SSR primers developed for them already. Currently, there is no simple and rapid method used for identifying the tetraploid Salix psammophila with SSR markers. In this study, we construct fingerprints among 261 accessions of S. psammophila by screening of marker combinations. We identified a nine-marker combination which could completely distinguish each of the 261 accessions to their unique fingerprinting profiles. For this marker combination (G+I+J+N+O+Q+S+T+U), identification rate of combined markers (MC2) and total Polymorphism Information Content (PIC) were the highest, at 100% and 6.05, respectively. We used fingerprinting profiles with the nine-marker combination to produce two-dimensional barcodes, which could be screened rapidly and conveniently using a barcode scanned by a computer. The results of this study can provide an efficient genetic toolkit for identification, traceability management and protection of intellectual property rights of particular accessions of tetraploid S. psammophila.

AB The use of camera vision to automatically detect head blight (scab) on wheat ears could provide information about the severity of this dangerous disease and help meet future food traceability requirements. Fusarium spp. is dangerous for both human and animal consumption and the ability to monitor symptom location and severity before the harvested product is further processed or stored could help determine whether the grain is fit for human/animal consumption, for bio-conservation, or is completely unusable.
   To generate various infection levels, field trials were conducted in 2008 and 2009 using wheat varieties with differing levels of susceptibility to the disease; plots were artificially infected with a spore suspension. A color (red, green, and blue) and a multispectral (red, infrared) camera system with real-time image analysis software were developed and compared to detect disease symptoms in the plots.
   The chlorophyll defect of the infected wheat ears was classified against the image background by setting binarization thresholds. The result was a black and white image. Single pixels or tiny clusters of pixels not belonging to the symptoms were eliminated by setting an area threshold. For both systems, a linear correlation was found between the camera and the visually detected disease levels of the wheat ears in the plots.
   In the non-infected control plots without disease symptoms, the multispectral system accurately measured "no disease" even though the digital color system detected too much infection (i.e., a false positive). The multispectral system showed a superior calibration capacity. While the color system had to calibrate for each variety, the multispectral system used only one calibration step before starting the measurements.

TI Mathematical model of postharvest variation in tomato color based on
   optimized response surface methodology

AB BACKGROUND Manual inspection and instrumentation form the traditional approach to determining tomato color but these methods only determine tomato color at a given moment and cannot predict dynamically how tomato color varies during storage and transportation. Such methods thus cannot help suppliers and retailers establish good management practices for the flexible control of tomato maturity, accurate judgment of market positioning in the industry, or during distribution and marketing. To address this shortcoming, this work first investigates how tomato color parameters (a* and h degrees) evolve through the various stages of maturity (green, turn, and light red) under different storage conditions. Based on experimental results, it develops an optimized response-surface model (RSM) by using differential evolution to predict how tomato color varies during storage. RESULTS Tomatoes are more likely to change color at high temperatures and under conditions of high humidity. Temperature affects tomato color more strongly than humidity. The accuracy of the RSM was confirmed by a good agreement with experiments. All determination coefficients R-2 of the RSMs for a* and h degrees are greater than 0.91. The mean absolute errors for a* and h degrees are 3.8112 and 5.6500, respectively. The root mean square errors for a* and h degrees are 4.6840 and 6.9198, respectively. CONCLUSION This research reveals how storage temperature and humidity affect the postharvest variations in tomato color and thus establishes a dynamic model for predicting tomato color. The proposed RSM provides a reliable theoretical foundation for dynamic, nondestructive monitoring of tomato ripeness in the cold chain. (c) 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB Honey contains DNA of all organisms that directly or indirectly have been involved in its production, including the DNA of the honey bees. Therefore, using DNA extracted from honey, it is possible to analyse DNA markers useful to authenticate its entomological origin. In this study we developed an assay that can distinguish two mitotypes within the mitochondrial C lineage of Apis mellifera: the C1 mitotype, mainly carried by A. m. ligustica subspecies; the C2 mitotype, that is highly specific for the A. m. carnica subspecies. This method is based on Sanger sequencing of an informative regions of the honey bee mitochondrial DNA. A total of 255 honey samples were analysed. These samples included 157 commercial honey samples produced in three Italian regions of the North of Italy, in which A. m. ligustica is widely spread and 15 honey samples directly obtained from honeycombs. Fifteen of these commercial samples and all samples from honeycombs were known to be produced by A. m. ligustica. Other commercial honey samples, produced in Slovenia (n 38), Croatia (n. 22) and Serbia (n. 23), derived from A. m. carnica. All honey samples produced by A. m. ligustica had only the C1 mitotype whereas all honey samples produced by A. m. carnica had the C2 mitotype. C1 was the most frequent mitotype in EmiliaRomagna region (Italy). This assay can be used to identify honey produced by these two subspecies and for population genetic studies in A. mellifera using the honey as source of DNA.

AB Soluble solid content (SSC) is one of the most important factors determining the quality and price of fresh fruits. However, the accurate assessment of SSC in some kinds of fruits with thick peel and large size is relatively difficult because it is important to select a suitable measurement position on this type of fruit. In this study, Hami' melon was used as the object of study, the visible and near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy with spectral range of 550-950nm was acquired from three positions (calyx, equator, and stem) of each sample to observe the effect of measurement positions on SSC assessment of whole Hami' melon. Three local models (calyx-region, equator-region, and stem-region models) and one global model based on the partial least squares (PLS) were developed with different preprocessing methods. Comparing all the established models, the results showed that the equator-region model and global model had the similar predictive performance which was better than ones of calyx-region and stem-region models. For improving the performance of models, the equator-region model and global model were further optimized based on different variable selection algorithms, including competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), uninformative variable elimination (UVE), combination algorithm CARS-SPA (successive projections algorithm), and combination algorithm UVE-SPA, respectively. And also, the linear multispectral PLS models and the nonlinear multispectral least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) models were established and compared using those selected characteristic variables, respectively. The results indicated that the performance of equator-region multispectral models was slightly superior to those of global multispectral models, and the optimal equator-region multispectral models were UVE-SPA-PLS (R-P=0.9143 and RMSEP=0.8359) and CARS-SPA-LSSVM (R-P=0.9134 and RMSEP=0.8958). The overall results indicated that it was feasible to develop the models using only the equator position information for detecting the SSC of whole Hami' melon. This study can provide some valuable references for building a fast and robust multispectral prediction model for SSC assessment in some kinds of fruits with thick peel and large size such as watermelon.

AB Aquaculture is the fastest growing animal producing sector in the world and is expected to play an important role in global food supply. Along with this growth, concerns have been raised about the environmental effects of escapees and pollution, fish welfare, and consumer health as well as the use of marine resources for producing fish feed. In this paper we present some of the major challenges salmon farming is facing today. We discuss issues of relevance to how to ensure sustainability, by focusing on animal production systems, breeding approaches, sources for feed ingredients, and genetic engineering strategies. Other crucial issues such as animal welfare, environmental quality, and ethics are elaborated with regard to relevance for the sustainability of aquaculture. Additionally, we comment on socio-economic distributive implications by intellectual property rights (IPR) strategies on access to genetic material and traceability. To improve sustainability of salmon farming we suggest that there is a need for new approaches to guide research, for identification of ethical issues, and for engaging stakeholders in resolving these challenges.

AB The carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen isotopic compositions in lamb meat and wool samples under two feeding regimes from five different regions of China were determined by IRMS, which is to investigate their potential for assigning the lamb meat according to geographical origins. The delta C-13, delta N-15 and delta H-2 values in lamb tissues had significant differences among different regions, with the delta C-13 value is highly related to that of the lamb feeds (p < 0.01) and the delta H-2 value is significantly correlated with lamb drinking water (p < 0.05). Moreover, delta C-13, delta N-15 and delta H-2 values of lamb muscle are all highly correlated with the wool samples. A total correct classification of 88.9% and 83.8% were obtained from the combination of C, N and H isotopes of lamb muscle and wool, respectively. These results demonstrate that multi-element isotopes are effective in identifying the geographical origin of lamb meat. Moreover, both muscle and hair tissue can be used for lamb traceability.

AB China has experienced frequent food safety incidents that have undermined consumer trust in the food supply chain. To overcome this problem, China requalified the legislative framework and adopted a comprehensive food certification system over the years. Here, we investigated the influences of food traceability and Chinese certifications (QS/SC-food quality safety market access/production system, hazard-free, green, and organic) on Chinese consumer trust of food safety for different types of products: fish, meat, milk, eggs, and rice. Data were collected through face-to-face surveys conducted in rural and urban Chinese areas. With a sample of 757 questionnaires, we ran a logit model. The results show consumers' uncertainty and skepticism of certifications guaranteeing food safety attributes, especially for animal-based products. We found that price is used as a cue of safety by Chinese consumers. Individuals with higher education seem less influenced by certifications and other cues included in the analysis. The findings demonstrate that Chinese policy makers should implement new strategies to enhance consumer food safety trust, and design policies by considering different categories (e.g., vegetables, meat, fish, etc.) of food.

AB The purpose of eco-labels is to encourage a move towards more environmentally friendly consumption patterns. The eco-label has been recognized as a means of promoting products with lower environmental impact. A considerable body of literature has focused on consumer demand for eco-label use: however, little attention has been paid to producers. Because the adoption decision is voluntary, a better understanding of producers' adoption behaviors towards eco-labels could significantly determine the effectiveness of the program. This paper contributes to this policy issue by assessing the impacts of the Taiwan Good Agricultural Products program, a combined eco-label and food traceability system, on the distribution of aquaculture producers' income in Taiwan. Using a unique aquaculture producer survey in Taiwan, we examine the extent to which label use may affect the level of income, income variability and income inequality of the producers. Our findings suggest that eco-label use increases income and that the effect is more pronounced for producers at the higher percentile range of income distribution. Label use also increases income variability, but no significant effect on income inequality is evident. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rapid and visual detection of the chemical compositions of plant seeds is important but difficult for a traditional seed quality analysis system. In this study, a custom-designed line-scan Raman hyperspectral imaging system was applied for detecting and displaying the main chemical compositions in a heterogeneous maize seed. Raman hyperspectral images collected from the endosperm and embryo of maize seed were acquired and preprocessed by Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter and adaptive iteratively reweighted Penalized Least Squares (airPLS). Three varieties of maize seeds were analyzed, and the characteristics of the spectral and spatial information were extracted from each hyperspectral image. The Raman characteristic peaks, identified at 477, 1443, 1522, 1596 and 1654 cm(-1) from 380 to 1800 cm(-1) Raman spectra, were related to corn starch, mixture of oil and starch, zeaxanthin, lignin and oil in maize seeds, respectively. Each single-band image corresponding to the characteristic band characterized the spatial distribution of the chemical composition in a seed successfully. The embryo was distinguished from the endosperm by band operation of the single-band images at 477, 1443, and 1596 cm(-1) for each variety. Results showed that Raman hyperspectral imaging system could be used for on-line quality control of maize seeds based on the rapid and visual detection of the chemical compositions in maize seeds.

AB Despite the recent interest towards food safety and control, it is generally difficult to ensure full products traceability through industrial food chains, due to the lack of efficient information and communication systems. Consequently, nowadays, the protection of food products often ends at the gates of the producer without any investigation about the status of their quality at the consumer's location. The aim of this paper was the development of a supply chain monitoring system based on a smart logistic unit (SLU) to support the integrated management of the food supply chain from "farm to fork" in order to guarantee and control food safety and shelf life (SL) of products in agreement with logistic efficiency and system sustainability. For this purpose we have conducted a research involving the selection of a perishable product significantly affected by logistic decisions, the determination of the set parameters representative of its quality and the development of a prototype of SLU, based on a sensor network for monitoring the identified parameters. Finally, an experimental SL model has been determined, based on the volatile organic compounds emitted from fruits and monitored by the SLU. We have validated the model by simulating real transport conditions and assessing the residual SL of the product at different time intervals.

AB The paper aimed to analyze the status of pork market during the period 2017-2019 under the impact of African Swine Fever (ASF) in order to assess the consequences on pig livestock, pork production, frade, and price compared to the period 2014-2016. Using the data provided by Faostat and National Institute of Statistics, and the usual methods specific to such an analysis: fixed index, trend line, regression equations and determination coefficient, the obtained results have pointed out that in the interval 2017-2019 versus 2014-2016, of pig livestock, ASF has amplified the decline of pig livestock, slaughtered pigs and their live weight, and pork production. The higher demand than offer on the domestic market increased imports to assure food security and increased pork price. Farmers are discouraged to grow pigs due to the lack of biological material, high price for piglets and feedstuff high production cost and the high risk that their business to fail, as long as subsidies and aids are missing in pig farming. In consequence, it is needed a new strategy which has to be adapted to the actual situation at the European level destined to counteract the spread of ASF by using efficient measures of traceability and biosecurity along the pork chain. Veterinary authorities have to join their forces to eradicate this disease and produce a vaccine for saving pig livestock. Subsidies and aids are required to sustain pig growing in Romania, where pork is a strategic food.

AB Multiple techniques were employed to extract characteristic fingerprint information of walnuts from the different regions of Xinjiang. Analysis was conducted using near- and mid-infrared spectroscopy, fatty acid and element data to establish geographic classification models of walnuts combined with chemometrics. The least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) model had a classification accuracy result of 98.8-100% for walnut samples from different geographical origins by NIR spectra. For the same variety of samples, PLSDA model also had high classification accuracy of 91-100% by MIR spectra. However, variance analysis showed that single element or fatty acid could not be differentiated between the three geographical origins of walnuts. In addition, the back propagation neural network classification model was used to analyze the elements found in the walnut specimens provided results with a mean accuracy of 89.7% for validation. This work demonstrated an acceptable feasibility of using multisource fingerprinting for differentiating regional and characteristic agriculture product to prevent frauds.
   Practical applicationsCurrently, there is no effective, simple and rapid technology to prevent frauds of walnuts in Xinjiang occurring in the market, especially walnuts with adulteration or which has been counterfeited. Hence, in this research, we provided a feasible method to differentiate the walnut from different regions based on multiple fingerprinting and geographic traceability techniques, which could be applied to prevent frauds of walnuts occurring in the market in the future.

ID SOLUBILITY; PATTERNS; PH
AB Context. Water is the first nutrient and an essential component of all agricultural production systems. Despite its importance there has been limited research on water, and in particular, the impact of its availability, management and quality on production systems.
   Aims. This research sought to describe the management and quality of water used within the Australian pig industry. Specifically, the water sources utilised, how water was managed and to evaluate water quality at both the source and the point of delivery to the pig.
   Methods. Fifty-seven commercial piggeries across Australia participated in this study by completing a written survey on water management. In addition, survey participants undertook physical farm parameter measurements including collecting water samples. Each water sample was tested for standard quality parameters including pH, hardness, heavy metals and microbiological status.
   Key results. Responses were received from 57 farms, estimated to represent at least 22% of 'large' pig herds. Bore water was the most common water source being utilised within the farms surveyed. Management practices and infrastructure delivering water from the source to the point of consumption were found to differ across the farms surveyed. Furthermore, water was regularly used as a delivery mechanism for soluble additives such as antibiotics. The quality of water at the source and point of consumption was found to be highly variable with many parameters, particularly pH, hardness, salinity, iron, manganese and microbiological levels, exceeding the acceptable standard.
   Conclusions. In general, water quality did not appear to be routinely monitored or managed. As a result, farm managers had poor visibility of the potential negative impacts that inferior water quality or management may be having on pig production and in turn the economics of their business. Indeed, inferior water quality may impact the delivery of antibiotics and in turn undermine the industry's antimicrobial stewardship efforts.
   Implications. The study findings suggest that water quality represents a significant challenge to the Australian pig industry. Access to drinking water of an acceptable quality is essential for optimal pig performance, health and welfare but also to ensure farm to fork supply chain integrity, traceability and food safety.

AB A new idea and strategy for honey traceability and identification was provided by studying the carbon isotope fractionation of rape honey and its components in the different ripening process, as well as the fractionation from rape flowers, stamens, nectar to rape honey. The results showed the moisture content of rape honey continued to decrease, and the glucose and fructose content continued to increase during the ripening process. The delta C-13 of rape honey and its protein were less affected by honey ripeness, while the delta C-13 of sugars in rape honey were greatly affected by this. At the same time, the fractionation of carbon isotope from rape flowers to honey was significant. The delta C-13 of rape honey and its protein, disaccharide, fructose, and glucose had a strong correlation, and the delta C-13 of rape honey and its components were mainly related to rape flowers and its stamens.

AB Lentil (Lens culinaris) is an important legume crop worldwide, consumed as dried seeds. Correct identification of lentil varieties is important in order to ensure food quality, safety, authenticity and health for consumers as well as high price from elite varieties for farmers and industry. Recently, DNA-based methods like the molecular markers microsatellites (SSRs) for nuclear DNA or the DNA barcoding which uses chloroplast or nuclear DNA have been developed for plant species or variety identification, for genotyping and for identification of their ingredients in the final food products. Here we have integrated High Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis, coupled with five SSR markers in parallel with rpoC1 chloroplast DNA barcode targeting region, in order to facilitate the identification of Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) lentil variety 'Eglouvi'. The five SSR loci used were informative and generated a unique melting curve profile of microsatellites for each of the ten varieties tested. SSRs enabled the distinction and identification of the "Eglouvi" lentil PGI variety and furthermore they allowed the traceability of "Eglouvi" and the identification of lentil varieties admixtures of 50%. In addition, the application of the Barcode DNA High Resolution Melting (Bar-HRM) method on the species specific plant DNA barcoding region rpoC1, allowed not only the identification of adulterations but also the quantification of the most common lentil admixture. Bar-HRM detected Vicia sativa adulterants in Lens esculentum pure seed mix as low as 1:100. Hence, these assays provided flexible, cost-effective, and closed-tube SSR-HRM and Bar-HRM genotyping methods, well suited to identify adulterants in variety and species level and to food forensic uses in food products.

AB European small ruminant systems are mainly situated in mountain areas and for the production model to be sustainable, the quality of products and traceability should be analysed. Technical data and bulk milk samples (n = 48 for each season) from 16 goat farms were collected each month during the four seasons of the year. According to the indicator Net energy provided by grazing on shrublands (NERG), farms were separated in High (n = 3, 59% NERG), Medium (n = 9, 39%) and Low (n = 4, 16%) Grazing groups. Samples were analysed for fatty acid (FA) profile and vitamin A and E contents, and was evaluated its utility to discriminate milk samples. Few differences were found in the analyzed parameters between farm groups. However, important changes were reported according to season. Spring milk (46% NERG) showed significantly higher levels of some healthy FA (total polyunsaturated, 4.67 0.044% of total FA; n-3, 0.94 0.017; conjugated linoleic acid total, 0.51 0.008), summer (37% NERG) and autumn (33% NERG) showed higher levels of a tocopherol (215.5 and 195.8 6.54 pg/100 g, respectively) and winter (32% NERG) showed higher levels of retinol (85.0 1.71 pg/ 100 g). The multivariate approach was able to discriminate milk from different seasons.

AB The waste generated by small-scale ultra-fresh juice producers, such as bistros and restaurants, has been little studied so far, mainly because it is unevenly distributed and dissipated in the economic ecosystem and would require high costs associated with transportation and subsequent recovery of bio composites. The present article seeks to offer solutions by providing sustainable methods to reduce their waste losses to a minimum and transform them into valuable products, with affordable equipment and techniques. The study focuses on the preliminary phase of quantitative analysis of fruit and vegetable by-products generated on a small scale, the results showing a mean 55% productivity in fresh juices. Due to the high amount of remnant water content in waste, a new process of mechanically pressing the resulting squeezed pulp was introduced, generating an additional yield in juice, ranging from 3.98 to 51.4%. Due to the rising trend in healthier lifestyle, the by-products were frozen or airdried for conservation in each of the processing stages, and the total phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity were analyzed in order to assess the traceability of these bioactive compounds to help maximize their transfer into future final products. The polyphenols transferred into by-products varied between 7 and 23% in pulps and between 6 and 20% in flours. The highest DPPH potential was found in flours, up to three-fold in comparison with the raw material, but the high dry substance content must be accounted for. The results highlight the potential of reusing the processing waste as a reliable source of bioactive compounds.

AB The ability to detect and quantify small amounts of DNA in biological complex samples is a hot research area. Up until recently most of the work performed in this area used label-dependent protocols that increases its complexity and overall costs. The aim the work was to develop a label-free technology suitable for DNA detection and quantification using real complex DNA samples. The applicability of this system was tested using synthetic ssDNA targets that guaranteed the systems specificity, in the sense that only complementary sequences hybridized with the probe. When using real samples extracted from Vitis vinifera L. the system was able to successfully detect and quantify the DNA present without any of the time consuming and costly amplification steps. The detection and quantification limits of the proposed system were 60 +/- 20 nM and 201 +/- 20 nM, respectively for Target 1 concentrations between 31 and 350 nM. This method can easily be applied to other species and purposes, allowing the direct detection of DNA in a label-free environment with high accuracy and specificity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB To determine the Minbei Shuixian tea from different region quickly and non-destructively, proton transfer reaction-time of flight-mass spectrometry (PTR-TOF-MS) was used to obtain chemical fingerprints of the volatile compounds of 113 samples directly from the surface of the dry tea leaves without any sample pretreatment in three regions (Wuyishan, Jianyang and Jiannu). The raw MS data were analyzed by multivariate analysis, including principal component analysis (PCA) and analysis of variance (ANOVA). In addition, soft independent modeling class analogy (SIMCA), K nearest neighbor algorithm (INN) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were used for pattern recognition. The experimental results demonstrated that in the positive ion mode, PTR-TOF-MS combined with multivariate analysis could effectively distinguish tea from different regions. Three principal components were extracted by PCA, and their cumulative contribution rate was 84.66%. The correct rates of the three sets of calibration models were 89.38%, 100.00%, 100.00%, and the accuracy rates of the prediction set were 83.18%, 96.46%, 95.57%, respectively. The different region pattern recognition model were successfully established. It was found that Shuixian tea in different regions of northern Fujian could be differentiated by PTR-TOF-MS and the results provided a basis for establishing a fast, non-destructive and sensitive detection method of tea, which could provide reference for geographical traceability.

AB The ban on using processed animal proteins in feedstuffs led the feed sector to look for other sources of protein. Dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) could be considered as an important source in this regard. They are imported into Europe mainly for livestock feed. Identifying their origin is essential when labelling is missing and for feed safety, particularly in a crisis situation resulting from contamination. This study investigated applying attenuated total reflection Fourier transform mid-infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FT-MIR) to the oil fraction extracted from samples in situ in order to identify the origin of DDGS. The use of spectroscopic and chemometric tools enabled the botanical and geographical origins of DDGS, as well as the industrial process used to produce them, to be identified. The models developed during the study provided a classification higher than 95% using an external validation set. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As a form of land degradation, soil erosion directly threatens the sustainability of natural resources and the environment. The impacts of humans on soil erosion are profound and complex, especially in the areas with frequent human activities. Moreover, the great variability of human activities at the spatial and time scales precludes a comprehensive understanding of how humans affect regional erosion. This study evaluated soil erosion by water from 1985 to 2015 occurring in South China, which is densely populated and has been intensively exploited, based on the Chinese Soil Loss Equation (CSLE) and multisource data including remote sensing images, meteorological station information and geographic data. A quantitative method combining traceability thinking and residual trend approach was employed to distinguish the relative contributions of climate change and human activities. The results showed that the average amount of soil erosion exhibited a significant decreasing trend from 1985 to 2015, which was consistent with the national water census data and previous studies. Anthropogenic factors played a more vital role than natural variables in the evolution of soil erosion, the multiyear average contribution of which was 63.90%. The area in which anthropogenic factors alleviated soil erosion covered approximately 83.70% of the study area. These results indicate that soil and water conservation practices have made outstanding contributions to the reduction of soil erosion in South China. However, the impacts of the expansion of building land and the development of plantations on aggravating soil erosion cannot be ignored. For future soil erosion control, we observed the diminishing marginal effect of investments in soil and water conservation, and a higher governance potential in the severely eroded regions, which made the severely eroded poor land a primary for comprehensive ecological management. This study aims to provide valuable insights for decision makers in South China to better understand the impacts of humans on the evolution of soil erosion and could provide scientific support for reducing regional soil loss and enhancing the sustainable development of the ecological environment.

Most relevant genes and mutations associated with pig morphological, productive, meat quality, reproductive and disease resistance traits were prioritized and analyzed in a maximum of 47 blood samples from each of the breeds (Alentejana, ApuloCalabrese, Basque, Bisara, Majorcan Black, Black Slavonian (Crna slavonska), Casertana, Cinta Senese, Gascon, Iberian, Kr6kopolje (Kr6kopoljski), Lithuanian indigenous wattle, Lithuanian White Old Type, Mora Romagnola, Moravka, Nero Siciliano, Sarda, Schwabisch-Hallisches Schwein (Swabian Hall pig), Swallow-Bellied Mangalitsa and Turopolje). We successfully analyzed allelic variation in 39 polymorphisms, located in 33 candidate genes. Results provide relevant information regarding genetic diversity and segregation of SNPs associated to production and quality traits. Coat color and morphological trait-genes that show low level of segregation, and fixed SNPs may be useful for traceability. On the other hand, we detected SNPs which may be useful for association studies as well as breeding programs. For instance, we observed predominance of alleles that might be unfavorable for disease resistance and boar taint in most breeds and segregation of many alleles involved in meat quality, fatness and growth traits. Overall, these findings provide a detailed catalogue of segregating candidate SNPs in 20 European local pig breeds that may be useful for traceability purposes, for association studies and for breeding schemes. Population genetic analyses based on these candidate genes are able to uncover some clues regarding the hidden genetic substructure of these populations, as the extreme genetic closeness between Iberian and Alentejana breeds and an uneven admixture of the breeds studied. The results are in agreement with available knowledge regarding breed history and management, although largest panels of neutral markers should be employed to get a deeper understanding of the population's structure and relationships.

AB Geographical indications of agricultural products are characterized by high quality and regional attributes, while they are more likely to be counterfeited by similar products from nearby regions. Accurate discrimination of origin on small geographical scales is extremely important for geographical indications of agricultural products to avoid food fraud. In this study, a widely targeted metabolomics based on ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry combined with multivariate statistical analysis was used to distinguish the geographical origin of Pinggu Peach of Beijing and its two surrounding areas in Heibei province (China). Orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) based on 159 identified metabolites showed significant separation from Pinggu and the other adjacent regions. The number of the most important discriminant variables (VIP value >1) was up to 62, which contributed to the differentiation model. The results demonstrated that the metabolic fingerprinting combined with OPLS-DA could be successfully implemented to differentiate the geographical origin of peach from small-scale origins, thus providing technical support to further ensure the authenticity of geographical indication products. The greenness of the developed method was assessed using the Analytical GREEnness Metric Approach and Software (ARGEE) tool. It was a relatively green analytical method with room for improvement.

AB In January 2019, the Safe Food for Canadians Act/Safe Food for Canadians regulations (heretofore identified as SFCR) came into force across Canada and brought a more streamlined process to food safety practice in Canada. Food trade and production processes have evolved rapidly in recent decades, as Canada imports and exports food products; therefore it is critically important to remain aware of the latest advances responding to a range of challenges and opportunities in the food safety value chain. Looking through the optics of the recent SFCR framework, this paper places the spotlight on leading domestic and international research and practices to help strengthen food safety policies of the future. By shedding some light on new research, we also draw attention to international developments that are noteworthy, and place those in context as to how new Canadian food safety policy and regulation can be further advanced. The paper will benchmark Canada through a review study of food safety best practices by juxtaposing (i) stated aspirations with, (ii) actual performance in leading Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) jurisdictions.

AB Considering the opportunities offered by the Chinese beef market and the fragilities in the Sino-Brazilian beef trade supply chain, this study aims to identify the main sources and channels used by Brazilian beef packers to obtain information on the Chinese market. The results reveal that the Brazilian beef packers and institutions within the export sector have little knowledge regarding the Chinese market. Neither the size nor the export experience of the beef packing firms and the foreign direct investment seem to significantly influence the quality of the knowledge they hold on the Chinese beef market. The sector has neither an integrated database containing the essential information on the Chinese market nor a unified traceability system in place that could facilitate the information flow among the agents within the beef supply chain. Consequently, firms need to dedicate substantial management resources (time, financial and human) to collect information from various sources.

AB A novel bacteriocin-producing strain, Lactobacillus plantarum JY22 isolated from golden carp intestine, was screened and identified by its physiobiochemical characteristics and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. This bacteriocin, named plantaricin JY22, was purified using ethyl acetate extraction and gel filtration. Its molecular weight was approximately 4.1 kDa by SDS-PAGE analysis. The partial amino acid sequence of plantaricin JY22 was DFGFDIPDEV. It was highly heat-stable and remained active at pH range from 2.5 to 5.5, but was sensitive to protease. Plantaricin JY22 had a bactericidal mode. Scanning electron microscope analysis indicated that plantaricin JY22 damaged the morphology of cells and spores for Bacillus cereus. Moreover, the plantaricin JY22 destroyed cell membrane integrity as confirmed by the leakage of electrolytes, the losses of Na+K+-ATP, AKP, nucleic acids (OD260nm) and proteins. SDS-PAGE of B. cereus proteins further demonstrated that plantaricin JY22 had a remarkable effect on bacterial proteins.

ID INDICATORS; CHEMISTRY
AB The development, implementation and social acceptance of resource efficient, circular, bio-based economies require critical understanding of the whole supply chain from feedstock to end-use. Trust, transparency and traceability will be paramount. Though life cycle assessment (LCA) is a universally chosen approach to fulfil this purpose, the nature of data required and the depth of analysis lead to complex interpretations of the findings. Herein, a new set of hybridised, first-line sustainability indicators, drawn from the principles of green chemistry and resource (material and energy) circularity, are reported. These flexible, potentially stand-alone metrics are demonstrated via application to an exemplary comparative LCA, incorporating the hybridised indicators including hazardous chemical use, waste generated, resource circularity and energy efficiency, from the "gate-to-gate" stages for the bio-based case studies and their petro-derived commercial counterparts. These metrics were observed to quantify critical new information relevant to our transition to a circular economy, bridging significant gaps in contemporary environmental impact assessment methodologies. Appropriate additional evaluations that examine the performance of metrics, when the embedded resource efficiency and circularity strategies are omitted, have also been undertaken and reported. The data drawn from employing these methods are crucial to inform and encourage operational optimisation, transparency in sustainability reporting and practices to a significant number of value-chain actors including manufacturers, policy makers and consumers.

AB Strong increase in the production of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) observed over the years has led to a consolidation of transgenic seed industries worldwide. The dichotomy between the evaluated risk and the perceived risk of transgenic use has defined their level of acceptability among different global societies. GMOs have been widely applied to agricultural commodities, among them the Roundup Ready (TM) (RR (TM)) soybean line GTS 40-3-2 has become the most prevalent transgenic crop in the world. This variety was developed to confer plant tolerance against glyphosate-based agricultural herbicide Roundup Ready (TM). Issues related to detection and traceability of GMOs have gained worldwide interest due to their increasing global diffusion and the related socioeconomic and health implications. Also, due to the widespread use of GMOs in food production, labelling regulations have been established in some countries to protect the right of consumers and producers. Besides regulatory demand, consumer concern issues have resulted in the development of several methods of detecting and quantifying foods derived from genetically engineered crops and their raw materials. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been proven to be the method of choice to detect the presence or absence of the introduced genes of GMOs at DNA level. The present paper aims to verify whether the PCR technique can detect RR (TM) soybean seeds among conventional ones to further certification as non-GM soybean seeds and grains. This analysis could be accomplished through the development of new methodology called 'intentional contamination' of soybean conventional seeds or grains with the respective RR (TM) soybeans. The results show that the PCR method can be applied with high sensitivity in order to certify conventional soybean seeds and grains.

AB n-Alkanes and n-alkenes are components of the unsaponifiable fraction of an olive oil. These were analysed by GC on-column analysis and are here proposed as an additional tool to certify the origin, authenticity, traceability and chemical quality of olive oil produced in the Reggio Calabria province (South Italy). Nine cultivars were studied: Cassanese, Coratina, Itrana, Leccino, Nociara, Ottobratica, Pendolino, Picholine and Sinopolese grown in the region of Calabria (South Italy). n-Alkanes in the range from 21 to 35 chain carbon atoms and alkenes in the range from 23:1 to 25:1 chain carbon atoms were found with the following elution order: heneicosane (C21), docosane (C22), tricosene (C23:1), tricosane (C23), tetracosene (C24:1), tetracosane (C24), pentacosene (C25:1), pentacosane (C25), hexacosane (C26), eptacosane (C27), octacosane (C28), nonacosane (C29), triacontane (C30), entriacontane (C31), dotriacontane (C32), tritriacontane (C33), tetratriacontane (C34), pentatriacontane (C35). The oil of all cultivars showed a decreasing trend in total n-alkane and n-alkene content, with the oil of Sinopolese showing the highest content, varying from 328.50 to 214.00 mg/kg. Odd-chain alkanes predominated over even-chain n-alkanes, and tricosane, tetracosane and pentacosane were the most represented alkanes. Cultivar and harvest date significantly influenced the n-alkane and n-alkene content. These findings can be useful to distinguish different olive cultivars and to decide the fruit harvest date for the oil of the Reggio Calabria province (South Italy). A daily quantity of 30 g of olive oil of the Sinoplese cv (the one with the highest n-alkane and n-alkene content) was found to be in accordance with the suggestions of the European Agency for the evaluation of medicinal products Committee for veterinary medicinal products and biogenic hydrocarbons intake for the human diet.

AB Food innovations can create novel nutritious food, improve agricultural sustainability, and increase the agri-food industry's market profits. Our study proposes a consensus definition of food innovations and forecasts food innovations that will be available to consumers in the next five years by using a Delphi study. Thirteen experts aged 35 to 85 from the US and the UK researching or working in agriculture and nutrition, public health, the agri-food industry, or food policy participated in three rounds of this Delphi study. The experts were chosen using the snowball sampling method. This study followed the implementation and data analysis guidelines popularized by the Rand Corporation. The consensus definition for food innovations (with 76.9% agreement) was that 'food innovations aid in the development, production, or transportation of new food products, processes, or technology to promote human health, food security, or environmental sustainability'. The specific food innovations, which had over 69% agreement, are ranked as (1) plant-based meat alternatives, (2) personalized nutrition, (3) natural foods, (4) new genetically modified organisms, (5) regenerative agriculture, (6) urban agriculture, (7) packing innovations, (8) alternative flours, (9) improving shelf life, (10) supply chain technologies, (11) improved soil health, and (12) technology for traceability. The food innovation definition and identified specific food innovations could further connect the agricultural value chain to develop novel nutritious foods and improve agricultural sustainability. Agri-food industry specialists, practitioners, researchers, and policymakers can advance food innovation development and research pinpointing the specific food innovations along the agricultural value chain.

AB Weather-monitoring instruments installed on hill and mountain agricultural sites are often forced into non-ideal positioning due to slopes, tree proximity and other obstacles such as rivers and rocks that primarily affect relative humidity, temperature and solar radiation. Moreover, data from these weather stations do not take into account the measurement uncertainties related to these influences. The aim of this study is to investigate weather instruments' calibration and positioning in a vineyard located in the Monferrato region in northwestern Italy. Meteorological data from two weather stations were analysed metrologically in terms of the evaluation of calibration uncertainty and traceability to the International System of Units (SI), and using a statistical test, with the purpose of evaluating primarily the effect of the sensors' calibration and positioning on sloping hills. To understand these influences better, and in order to improve vineyard disease predictions reducing the use of chemicals in agriculture, the data recorded from the weather stations were included with the calibration uncertainties and used as inputs in an epidemiological forecasting model. The inclusion of the calibration uncertainties and positioning contribution affected disease prediction by up to five days; this can be explained by the effect of the tree canopy's spatial arrangement, which tends to alter the vineyard's microclimate.

AB Simple Summary Neglected and underutilized plants (NUPs) are significant resources that are often endemic to small geographical territories. Focusing on the Tunisian local endemic Teucrium luteum subsp. gabesianum (Lamiaceae) and using Geographical Information Systems and online databases, we created a detailed ecological profiling for this taxon in terms of temperature and climate conditions required for sustaining wild-growing populations in situ, and we showed how temperature affects its ex-situ seed germination, thus making its cultivation in anthropogenic environments possible for the first time. We further investigated the growth and pilot cultivation of seedlings responding to chemical and integrated nutrient management (INM) fertilizers, outlining the advantageous effect of INM. The first-reported herein DNA barcoding offers insight regarding the taxonomic circumscription of other Teucrium taxa, enables future traceability in products, and may be useful in future product design. The multidisciplinary approach followed herein may bridge research gaps hindering the conservation efforts and/or the sustainable exploitation of this local endemic NUP of Tunisia to date. As a result, the feasibility and readiness timescale for its sustainable exploitation was re-evaluated, upgrading (>two-fold) its potential value for the medicinal-cosmetic, agro-alimentary, and ornamental-horticultural sectors. In the context of plant conservation and sustainable use of unique neglected and underutilized phytogenetic resources, this study focused on the Tunisian local endemic Teucrium luteum subsp. gabesianum (Lamiaceae). Using Geographical Information Systems and online databases, detailed taxon-specific ecological profiling was produced for the first time, which illustrated the temperature and climate conditions in its wild habitats and facilitated the investigation of how temperature affects its seed germination, thus making its cultivation in anthropogenic environments possible. Following the seed propagation first reported herein (77.5-81.25% at temperatures between 15 and 25 degrees C), species-specific in situ and ex situ conservation efforts or sustainable exploitation strategies can be enabled. This study also reported for the first time how chemical and integrated nutrient management (INM) fertilizers affect the growth and pilot cultivation of its seedlings (INM more advantageous). The firstly-reported herein DNA barcoding may enable its traceability, allowing future product design. The multidisciplinary approach followed has paved the way to bridge important research gaps hindering conservation efforts and/or the sustainable exploitation of this local Tunisian endemic plant to date. Based on the aforementioned results, the feasibility and readiness timescale for its sustainable exploitation was overviewed and re-evaluated herein, upgrading (>two-fold) its potential value for the medicinal-cosmetic, agro-alimentary, and ornamental-horticultural sectors.

AB Ensuring an acceptable level of edible agro-products quality and safety is necessary to provide adequate protection for consumers. It is the first time that we analyzed the edible agro-products quality and safety issues in the supply chain, including production, processing, circulation, and consumption. The results indicate that the agro-products quality and safety levels improves steadily, and the supervision system and standardization system are both enhanced significantly, however, certain challenges still remain in each stage of the supply chain and the entire supervision process. Finally, five recommendations regarding four aspects (production, processing, circulation, and consumption) are concluded.

AB Three different synthetic polymers commonly used in drilling fluids (carboxymethyl cellulose - CMC, hydroxyethyl cellulose - HEC and polyacrylamide - PAA) were analysed by off-line-pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (off-line-Py-GC-MS). The aim of this study was to determine specific environmental marker compounds for the identification of contamination due to drilling activities. In a first step, reference materials of the main constituents of commonly applied water-based drilling fluids were purchased and analysed to identify potential indicator substances. For each polymer a set of two to three specific pyrolysis products was determined. Afterwards, four CMC, one HEC and two PAA based drilling fluids were pyrolysed in order to retrieve the previously identified compounds in drilling fluid mixtures. All indicator compounds were identified. In a third step, spiking experiments on drill cutting samples of various depths of one well proved the traceability of the applied polymers and verified the applicability of the indicator systems in terms of sensitivity and specificity.

AB Purpose
   In this paper, multi-period location-inventory-routing problem (LIRP) considering different vehicles with various capacities has been investigated for the supply chain of red meat. The purpose of this paper is to reduce variable and fixed costs of transportation and production, holding costs of red meat, costs of meeting livestock needs and refrigerator rents.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The considered supply chain network includes five echelons. Demand considered for each customer is approximated as deterministic using historical data. The modeling is performed on a real case. The presented model is a linear mixed-integer programming model. The considered model is solved using general algebraic modeling system (GAMS) software for data set of the real case.
   Findings
   A real-world case is solved using the proposed method. The obtained results have shown a reduction of 4.20 per cent in final price of red meat. Also, it was observed that if the time periods changed from month to week, the final cost of meat per kilogram would increase by 43.26 per cent.
   Originality/value
   This paper presents a five-echelon LIRP for the meat supply chain in which vehicles are considered heterogeneous. To evaluate the capability of the presented model, a real case is solved in Iran and its results are compared with the real conditions of a firm, and the rate of improvement is presented. Finally, the impact of the changed time period on the results of the solution is examined.

AB The study looks at the problems facing coastal fishing communities. It highlights the impacts that, in the complex framework of the EU reforms, have manifested themselves on economic activities and on society. The aim of the paper is twofold: to examine small-scale artisanal fishing in an area of Southern Italy in order to develop resilience and diversification and at the same time to outline the profiles of local bluefish buyers to highlight development strategies for the sector. The research carried out through a direct survey by administering a questionnaire to fishermen operating in areas of Southern Italy and the data cross-referenced with the opinions of local consumers. A conjoint experiment, followed by a multiple correspondence analysis and cluster identification, was used to outline the profiles of local bluefish buyers. The results of the analysis reveal that the fish market and the restaurant sector are the main distribution channels preferred by fishermen. Furthermore, fishermen are very sensitive to environmental issues and are willing to collaborate and actively participate in the environmental protection of the sea. Consumers recognise the quality of local bluefish, and they implicitly perceive the sustainability of the method of capture. The results show the need to undertake synergistic actions for the fishing industry, capable of activating marketing strategies adequately to support, promote and develop the sector. The results of the study provide helpful information for food companies in order to better segment their market and target their consumers, as well as to effectively promote their product using brands, certifications and traceability.

ID EQUINE WELFARE; UNWANTED HORSES; DEMOGRAPHIC-SURVEY
AB Recently, considerable international attention has been paid to the problem of unwanted horses. In Ireland, stray horses, particularly in urban areas, are a further problem. The Control of Horses Act 1996 was enacted in response to an ongoing problem of uncontrolled horses in public places. As yet, no research work has been conducted focusing on stray horses in Ireland. This paper describes horses impounded under the Act in the Munster region of Ireland during 2005-2012 and the factors influencing decisions regarding their disposal. A logistic regression model was developed to investigate factors influencing the probability that a horse was euthanised during impoundment. In total, 3625 seizure events were recorded, most towards the end of the study period. Predictors for euthanasia during 2010-2012 included seizure location, sex, age, colour, body condition score and year. This study highlights the problem of stray horses in Ireland, particularly in urban areas. There is a need for rigorous enforcement of newly enacted horse identification legislation, allowing a fully integrated traceability system. More is required to manage the long-established societal problems of stray horses in urban settings, with a uniform approach by all Local Authorities being long overdue.

AB In Italy, wine production is considered a sector of excellence, where the wines' appreciable sensory features are favored by environmental factors, including weather and climate conditions, which benefit territories with a specific vocation. The whole chain involves many economic and agri-food sector operators, and requires an in-depth assessment of specific risks for identifying critical points, keeping the entire production process under control, and ensuring product traceability. This article describes the results of a pilot study conducted in the Prosecco DOCG (Designations of Controlled and Guaranteed Origin) area, concerning the detection of residues of plant protection products in fifty wine bottles. Although considerably below the maximum residue levels, all the samples tested were positive, ranging from two to five active substances detected in each sample. In addition to the provisions of the European Community legislation, this paper critically evaluates some best practices models that are already used by the Wine Federations of Italy, with the aim of identifying advantages of and areas for improvement in production methods, applicable to raw materials reception, rasping, storage, and bottling phases, in order to guarantee product safety and quality.

AB During the last century wheat landraces were replaced by modern wheat cultivars leading to a gradual process of genetic erosion. Landraces genotyping and phenotyping are strategically useful, as they could broaden the genetic base of modem cultivars. In this research, we explored Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers diversity in a collection of common and durum wheats, including both landraces and Italian elite cultivars. A panel of 6,872 SNP markers was used to analyze the genetic variability among the accessions, using both the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and the Neighbour Joining clustering method. PCA analysis separated common wheat accessions from durum ones, and allowed to group separately durum landraces from durum elite cultivars. The Neighbour joining clustering validated PCA results, and moreover, separated common wheat landraces from common elite cultivars. The clustering results demonstrated that Italian durum landraces were poorly exploited in modern breeding programs. Combining cluster results with heterozygosity levels observed, it was possible to clarify synonymy and homonymy cases identified for Bianchetta, Risciola, Saragolla, Timilia and Dauno III accessions. The SNP panel was also used to detect the minimum number of markers to discriminate the studied accessions. A set of 33 SNPs were found to be highly informative and used for a molecular barcode, which could be useful for cultivar identification and for the traceability of wheat end-products.

AB Holstein-Friesian cattle exhibit individually-characteristic black and white coat patterns visually akin to those arising from Turing's reaction-diffusion systems. This work takes advantage of these natural markings in order to automate visual detection and biometric identification of individual Holstein-Friesians via convolutional neural networks and deep metric learning techniques. Existing approaches rely on markings, tags or wearables with a variety of maintenance requirements, whereas we present a totally hands-off method for the automated detection, localisation, and identification of individual animals from overhead imaging in an open herd setting, i.e. where new additions to the herd are identified without re-training. We find that deep metric learning systems show strong performance even when many cattle unseen during system training are to be identified and reidentified - achieving 93.8% accuracy when trained on just half of the population.

AB Due to its drug resistant nature, beta-lactamase represents a serious challenge for public health. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella pneumoniae clones are increasingly reported worldwide. Little is known about the prevalence and biological characteristics of drug-resistant strains in zoos. During routine surveillance at the Zhengzhou Zoo of China, we found Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate in healthy Red Kangaroos (Macropus Rufus) with severe MDR. The Klebsiella pneumoniae were especially resistant to Cefuroxime Sodium (MIC, > 64 mu g/mL), Ceftriaxone (MIC, >8 mu g/mL) and Cefepime (MIC, >64 mu g/mL), and belonged to ST290. Subsequently, whole genome sequencing (WGS) showed that the Chrome Chr-M297-1 harbored bla(DHA-3), bla(SHV-1), bla(CTX-M-14), fosA5, dfrA3, sul3, etc., and pM297-1.1 [222,864 bp, IncFIB(K)], which carried nine antimicrobial genes including bla(CTX-M-14), bla(TEM-191), aph(3 '')-Ib, aph(6)-Id and qnrS1, etc., and pM297-1.2 [225,763 bp, IncFII(K)] carried 22 antimicrobial genes including bla(TEM-1), bla(CTX-M-3), aph(3 ')-Ia, aac(3)-IIa, aac(6 ')-Ib-cr, aadA16, qnrB2, qnrS1, qacE Delta 1, mphA, sul1, and dfrA27, etc. A traceability analysis then revealed that these two plasmids were highly similar to those recovered from human clinical samples in some southern cities in Sichuan Province, China (>99%), suggesting that these plasmids are spreading in China. Furthermore, two plasmids harboring conjugal transfer genes facilitated the transmission of antimicrobial genes by conjugation with E. coli J53. Our research shows that the transmission and adaptation of Klebsiella pneumoniae producing ESBLs is occurring in zoo environments, suggesting that zoos may be becoming important potential reservoirs for clinically important drug-resistant genes. It is therefore necessary to monitor the emergence and spread of drug-resistant gene strains in captive wild animals held in zoo environments.

AB The application of certified reference materials (CRMs) to genetically modified organism (GMO) detection is essential for guaranteeing the accuracy, comparability, and traceability of quantitative results over time and among laboratories. Clean leaves from GM rice Kefeng 6 were used as raw materials to develop a batch of genomic DNA (gDNA) CRMs. The optimized KF6/PLD duplex digital PCR was used for collaborative characterization of Kefeng 6 gDNA CRMs by eight qualified laboratories; this batch of gDNA CRMs was certified for two property values, namely, copy number ratio and copy number concentration, which were 1.03 +/- 0.04 and (1.60 +/- 0.11) x 10(5) copies/mu L, respectively. The gDNA CRMs displayed good between-vial homogeneity when the minimum sample intake of 2 mu L was taken into account. Stability studies indicated that the gDNA CRMs should be transported below 25 degrees C, and cold chain transport was recommended. Shelf life was assessed to be at least 12 months, and when using gDNA CRMs, freeze-thaw should not exceed 10 cycles. Compared to the available gDNA CRMs in the market, this batch of gDNA CRMs has accurate property values with combined uncertainties, providing user-friendly calibrators for GM rice Kefeng 6 inspection and monitoring. The development and characterization of Kefeng 6 gDNA CRMs contribute to the establishment of a copy number-based reference system for GMO detection.

AB The cocoa bean shell (CBS) is one of the main cocoa byproducts with a prospective to be used as a functional food ingredient due to its nutritional and sensory properties. This study aims to define the chemical fingerprint of CBSs obtained from cocoa beans of diverse cultivars and collected in different geographical areas of Venezuela assessed using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to photodiodes array and mass spectrometry (HPLC-PDA-MS/MS) and spectrophotometric assays combined with multivariate analysis for classification purposes. The study provides a comprehensive fingerprint and quantitative data for 39 compounds, including methylxanthines and several polyphenols, such as flavan-3-ols, procyanidins, and N-phenylpropenoyl amino acids. Several key cocoa markers, such as theobromine, epicatechin, quercetin-3-O-glucoside, procyanidin_A pentoside_3, and N-coumaroyl- L-aspartate_2, were found suitable for the classification of CBS according to their cultivar and origin. Despite the screening methods required a previous purification of the sample, both methodologies appear to be suitable for the classification of CBS with a high correlation between datasets. Finally, preliminary findings on the identification of potential contributors for the radical scavenging activity of CBS were also accomplished to support the valorization of this byproduct as a bioactive ingredient in the production of functional foods.

AB Guizhou green tea is a provincial-scale protected geographical indication (PGI) product with high value and good reputation. However, induced by economic benefit, deliberate origin mislabeling and adulteration of Guizhou green tea become significant in the market. Reliable methods for authenticating the origins of green tea are therefore needed to counteract deliberate mislabeling and protect genuine Guizhou green tea. In this study, we analyze the signatures of four stable isotope and thirty-one mineral element in green tea samples collected from different provinces of China (Guizhou, Hubei and Guangdong) and different counties of Guizhou province (Duyun, Leishan and Meitan). We show that the 82H and 818O values are significantly higher in green tea samples collected from Hubei, which may be attributed to the strong secondary evaporation induced by low relative humidity. We also show that mineral element contents in green tea samples exhibit obvious regional differences, e.g. Fe, Mn, Cu, rare earth elements. These differences are mainly explained by the soil environment (i.e. soil properties, geological background and mineral resources) and are probrally correlated with climate change. Moreover, we investage the possibility of authenticating Guizhou green tea at the provincial and prefectural scales, using stable isotope and mineral element signatures combined with principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLSDA). The prediction accuracies of the LDA and OPLS-DA methods are all greater than 97% under the validation by cross-validation and external validation. The 82H value and the contents of K, V, Co, Cu, Zn and Ce, are identified as important variables for discrimination between green tea samples collected from the three different provinces. The contents of Dy, Er, Gd, Ho, Sm, Tb, Tm and Yb are key factors for secondary classification of Guizhou green tea samples collected from the three different counties. This strategy combining stable isotope and mineral element analysis is thus a powerful tool for authenticating Guizhou green tea from green tea with differing geographical origins, including those from nearby regions.

AB Rapid, sensitive and on-site monitoring of meat spoilage is highly essential for food safety. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) a typical volatile, produced during enzymatic hydrolysis is considered as a reliable marker for evaluating meat freshness. Herein, a novel nano-bionic sensor based on the superior catalytic activity of ruthenium nanoparticles (Ru NPs) has been fabricated for H2S quantification. The activity sites of Ru NPs were poisoned in the presence of H2S, thereby affecting its catalytic efficiency via reducing the degradation of azo dye. The developed nano-bionic sensor achieved a selective response toward H2S, with capability for on-site surveillance of the pork freshness in the linear range (0?1800 nM). A higher correlation was obtained between the H2S content and the total viable count during the 9-period pork spoilage process (R2 = 0.9633 and 0.9769). Moreover, the proposed method exhibits high selectivity in the presence of other characteristic volatiles encountered during the pork storage process.

AB Purpose Motivated by transformations in global food systems and increasing demand for multidimensional credence attributes, the authors analyze cacao value chains in Ecuador - the main producer of fine and flavor cacao worldwide. The authors identify opportunities and discuss how private and public sector initiatives can help meet emerging challenges. Design/methodology/approach Primary information was collected through interviews of actors in the Ecuadorian industry during spring/summer 2020, including cacao producer associations, exporter associations, chocolate processing firms, public institutions and local universities. Two focus groups were also conducted with producers from associations in the Ecuadorian Amazon. Findings Findings suggest new opportunities for cacao producers and chocolate processors have emerged from the global market transformation. To exploit these, firms need to personalize and differentiate their products, for example, by using quality certifications such as organic and fair trade. Market developments, such as European cadmium regulations and the necessity of worldwide traceability systems, are driving exporters to enhance Ecuador's cacao value chains. The sector still requires coordination to reap the benefits associated with demands for credence attributes. Originality/value Findings are supported by two case studies. The first focuses on how associativity can help those producing high-quality beans to differentiate themselves in modern agri-food markets. The second describes the success of a local chocolate firm and its links with local farmers.

AB In this study, Canadian consumers' preferences for enhanced carnosine (a naturally occurring dipeptide that exhibits antiaging properties) in pork are examined. Carnosine is a relatively unknown nutrient to the public such that we are interested in understanding the relative merits of informing consumers of enhanced carnosine levels through a possible health claim, a nutrient content claim or including it in the nutrition facts table (NFT). As a basis of comparison, we include two other possible labels, a protein nutrient content claim, and a Verified Canadian Pork label (created by industry identifying food safety, animal care, traceability, and farm to table quality assurance attributes of the production system). Data were collected through an online survey that included a choice experiment and were analyzed using conditional logit and random parameters logit models. Compared to carnosine (as a functional attribute), consumers prefer the identification of protein content. In terms of labeling carnosine, consumers have higher willingness to pay for carnosine content included in a NFT than for nutrient or health claims. Higher levels of nutrition knowledge are associated with higher willingness to pay for the different pork attributes.

ID DNA BARCODING APPROACH; AUTHENTICATION; TOOL; ADULTERATION
AB Tea, a popular aromatic infusion and food supplement, prepared from Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze leaves, is often subjected to adulteration with various undeclared inorganic and plant-derived materials. Cashew (Anacardium occidentale L.) nut husk is one of the most common plant tea adulterants. To date, there are limited DNA-based technologies for tea authentication and quantitative detection of adulterants. Herein, we used a universal plant DNA barcoding marker coupled with High Resolution Melting (Bar-HRM) analysis to authenticate tea products from cashew ground nut. Additionally, cashew-specific markers coupled with HRM technology were used to detect and quantify adulteration of tea with cashew DNA. This methodology can reliably detect admixtures as low as 1% v/v cashew in commercial tea products. Overall, our results demonstrate that the HRM technology is a strong molecular approach in tea authentication, capable of detecting very low adulterations in DNA admixtures.
   Practical Application In this study, we established the use of high-resolution DNA-based technologies for the detection of cashew adulteration in tea, even in very low quantities. The technology could be applied to a greater range of plant-based tea adulterants. This work is expected to facilitate the traceability and authenticity of tea products and form the basis for the development of strategies against fraudulent practices.

AB Background Waste disposal is an activity that pollutes the environment. The European Union has developed different legislative measures which are based on the circular economy (CE) to avoid this negative externality. The management of agricultural packaging (fertilizers and phytosanitary products) is carried out through Collective Deposit, Return, and Refund Systems (CDRRS). New regulations on waste tax the consumption of non-recyclable plastic in packaging, but also reward the use of plastic by-products from packaging. The administrations recommend using biodegradable plastic in the means of production, as well as establishing a traceability system (TS) to control the proper management of all the generated waste. The proposed measures can affect producer cost accounts. This work aimed to identify and evaluate the existing agricultural packaging management system in Spain. It also studied the influence of the price of a barrel of oil, crop surface, irrigation regime, and the type of subsectors on CDRRS, and quantified the impact of the latest fiscal measures and initiatives proposed by Spanish administrations. Results The generation of agricultural packaging is influenced by variables including the cultivated area, irrigation regime, and agricultural subsector. The price of a barrel of oil directly influences the current by-product utilization system. Using biodegradable plastic or implementing a TS can increase production costs by up to 9.80%. The current system of subsidies to producers can soften the economic impact caused by the additional cost of biodegradable plastic (4.03%), but no subsidies have been foreseen to encourage the use of environmentally friendly alternatives. Conclusions Findings indicate that public administrations should be guided by the specific characteristics of the different agricultural systems when defining regulations on agricultural waste management. The fixed rate in the current system of subsidies for using plastic by-products obtained from packaging should be substituted for a variable rate. Transferring powers to autonomous communities to define by-products may lead to heterogeneity in the Spanish territory. New measures derived from the recent environmental agreements to comply with the 2030 Agenda will increase production costs even after considering the current aid scheme. The subsidy coefficient should be increased to 80% of the purchase invoice.

AB In recent years, food adulteration incidents have occurred frequently, which poses a huge threat to food safety. This problem has become the focus of people's attention and hotspots for discussion. Therefore, the realization of fast, accurate and non-destructive testing of food adulteration is of great significance for ensuring food quality and safety. With the continuous emergence of new food raw materials, additives and food processing technologies, food adulteration is being technical, invisible and diversified, bringing more severe challenges to adulterate identification. At present, there have been some new methods for effective food adulteration detection, including high-performance liquid chromatography, stable carbon isotope ratio method, etc. However, due to the complex pretreatment of the sample and the high technical requirements for the detection instrument operation, these methods' application has been limited. Hence, A new type of non-destructive technology with high sensitivity and fingerprint characteristics is necessarily required. Terahertz (THz) spectrum refers to electromagnetic waves with a frequency from 0. 1 to 10 THz, between microwaves and infrared waves, which has the advantages of fingerprint characteristics, coherence, security, etc. Since the skeleton vibration, dipole rotation, and vibration transition of most macromolecules in organic substances and the weak interaction between them can be reflected in the THz spectrum. The THz technology possesses great potential in food adulteration detection. This paper elaborated THz spectroscopy technology's detection mechanism and reviewed the latest research progress of food adulteration detection by THz spectroscopy, including genetically modified foods identification, food geographical origin traceability, adulteration detection of dairy products, honey and other foods. Then, THz spectrum technology's existing application problems in food adulteration detection were analyzed, such as moisture influence, scattering influence, etc. At last, the applications of the THz spectrum technology in the food adulteration detection field prospected, such as the development of low-cost THz sources and detectors to promote the popularization and application of terahertz technology, the use of machine learning algorithms for THz spectrum modeling and analysis to improve model accuracy and analysis speed, combination with other modern detection technologies to achieve advantageous complementarities, etc. This paper is expected to provide reference and guidance THz spectrum technology research in food adulteration detection.

AB Wheat fulfills 20% of global caloric requirement. World needs 60% more wheat for 9 billion population by 2050 but climate change with increasing temperature is projected to affect wheat productivity adversely. Trait improvement and management of wheat germplasm requires genomic resource. Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) being highly polymorphic and ubiquitously distributed in the genome, can be a marker of choice but there is no structured marker database with options to generate primer pairs for genotyping on desired chromosome/physical location. Previously associated markers with different wheat trait are also not available in any database. Limitations of in vitro SSR discovery can be overcome by genome-wide in silico mining of SSR. Triticum aestivum SSR database (TaSSRDb) is an integrated online database with three-tier architecture, developed using PHP and MySQL and accessible at http://webtom.cabgrid.res.in/wheatssr/. For genotyping, Primer3 standalone code computes primers on user request. Chromosome-wise SSR calling for all the three sub genomes along with choice of motif types is provided in addition to the primer generation for desired marker. We report here a database of highest number of SSRs (476,169) from complex, hexaploid wheat genome (similar to 17 GB) along with previously reported 268 SSR markers associated with 11 traits. Highest (116.93 SSRs/Mb) and lowest (74.57 SSRs/Mb) SSR densities were found on 2D and 3A chromosome, respectively. To obtain homozygous locus, e-PCR was done. Such 30 loci were randomly selected for PCR validation in panel of 18 wheat Advance Varietal Trial (AVT) lines. TaSSRDb can be a valuable genomic resource tool for linkage mapping, gene/QTL (Quantitative trait locus) discovery, diversity analysis, traceability and variety identification. Varietal specific profiling and differentiation can supplement DUS (Distinctiveness, Uniformity, and Stability) testing, EDV (Essentially Derived Variety)/IV (Initial Variety) disputes, seed purity and hybrid wheat testing. All these are required in germplasm management as well as also in the endeavor of wheat productivity.

AB This study focuses on consumers' behaviour towards Fruits and Vegetables (FVs) under economic crisis. The implementation of both factor analysis and logistic regression reveals discrete consumer groups, affected and not affected by the ongoing economic crisis. Interviewees were selected randomly. In total, 250 questionnaires were completed and 238 of them were used for computations. There are two consumer groups, one affected by the crisis and one which did not. For the former, the price criterion prevails, while for the latter parameters like locality of production and heath concerns lead them to purchasing decisions. The economic crisis has reduced the quantities of FVs being consumed, and the retail chain stores fail to meet the criteria of locality and secure traceability procedures about the origin of the products. Nevertheless, educated consumers with higher incomes prefer to visit super markets, while elderly people with low incomes prefer grocery stores and open markets.

AB The Southern African Development Community (SADC) region includes 15 member states which all face growing population numbers and a possible protein shortage within the next 20 years. Although these countries have a wealth of livestock genetic resources and mostly are quite agriculturally dependent, there exist clear limitations and challenges regarding animal recording, genetic improvement, production efficiency and the implementation of new technologies, such as genomic selection (GS). Genomic selection incorporates genomic information with phenotypic information (breeding values) to derive genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) and leads to an increased rate of genetic improvement. The countries within the SADC region are in several stages of development with regard to agriculture and infrastructural development and this limits the implementation of advanced technologies. The establishing of reference populations seems beyond the capacity of most of these countries at present, mainly in terms of financial viability, infrastructural support and national cohesion. Genomic technology however holds potential for the introgression of favourable genes in resource-poor livestock production systems and traceability of livestock products. Furthermore, identification of traits associated with adaptability and disease resistance and unique products would contribute to food security on various levels. This review discusses interventions that may mitigate constraints, and proposes key research areas needed for addressing the limitations mentioned. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Following the discovery of horsemeat in beef products in Europe in 2013, restoring consumers' confidence in processed meat products as well as in all the agencies involved producers, food safety authorities, retailers soon became a key priority. However, the European public's confidence in processed meat products and their views about government and industry actions to manage fraudulent practices in the wake of this incident are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to identify the core issues affecting consumers' confidence in the food industry, particularly in the meat processing sector, and to explore the impact of the horsemeat incident on consumers' purchasing and eating behaviour. It involved the use of an online deliberation tool VIZZATA (TM) to collect detailed views of 61 consumers in the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Many participants reported buying fewer products containing processed meat as a result of the horsemeat incident. These respondents also claimed that their confidence in processed foods containing meat was lower than before the incident. Participants suggested restoring consumer confidence through improved traceability, sourcing local ingredients, providing clearer and correct labelling and stating the origin of meat on pack. Overall, findings indicate that rebuilding consumer confidence in processed meat products following a food adulteration episode is a multifaceted and difficult process. Food authorities and the food industry can benefit from the insights provided by this study to address issues affecting consumer confidence and to improve their communication strategies during future food adulteration incidents.

AB Carotenoids are widespread isoprenoid secondary metabolites. They and their metabolites are thought to provide diverse health benefits. In any case, their relevance from a nutritional standpoint is unarguable, as some of them can be converted into vitamin A in animals. Animals cannot synthesize carotenoids de novo and rely on the diet as a source. Species-specific differences in the absorption and metabolism of these compounds are known to exist among livestock species. The diet is another key factor affecting the carotenoid content in biological fluids (such as plasma and milk) and tissues. The study of carotenoids in animals is also important in the context of the increasing interest of consumers in the authentication of animal diets, as they can be used as markers of pasture-fed animals. In this paper, the authors review the current knowledge on the effect of the diet on the carotenoid levels of domesticated animals and the differences in the metabolism of these compounds into vitamin A among species.

AB The prevalence of staphylococcal infection and the emergence of multidrug resistance of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) are major concerns in food safety and public health. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of S. aureus isolated from traditional Chinese Rubing and Rushan cheese, antimicrobial resistance profiles, genomic characteristics, and predict antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs). From 124 samples, 18 of 62 (29.03%) of Rubing and 5 of 62 (8.06%) of Rushan cheese were confirmed to be S. aureus positive by standard culture-based methods. Twenty-three coagulase-positive staphylococci isolates were grouped into 16 clusters by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and subjected to routine susceptibility testing to 12 antibiotics. Those isolates exhibited high resistance to penicillin (100%), erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (34.78%), oxacillin, clindamycin, and cefoxitin (21.74%). Multidrug-resistant (MDR) S. aureus was found in 34.78% (8 of 23) of isolates. Further, S. aureus strain DC.RB_015 isolated from Rubing cheese, recognized as the most resistant to six antibiotics, was selected for whole-genome sequencing (WGS), continued with in silico approaches. S. aureus DC.RB_015 had a single chromosome size of 2,794,578 bp and a plasmid size of 22,961 bp. The strain harbored 18 predicted ARGs, including eight efflux pump genes (mepA, tet(K), arlR, arlS, norA, mgrA, tet(38), LmrS), one peptidoglycan biosynthesis gene (bacA), two beta-lactams resistance genes (mecA, blaZ), and seven genes conferring other antimicrobial resistance (APH(3 ')-IIIa, aad(6), ErmB, SAT-4, mecR1, GlpT, murA). The results of this study expand the knowledge of S. aureus strain DC.RB_015, increase food safety awareness, and will be helpful in establishing therapeutic therapy.

AB The authenticity of rice has become an important issue over the last few years. Many techniques have been employed in rice authentication including geographical origin, cultivar discrimination, organic rice authenticity, and impurities detection in rice. This review paper is attempted to highlight the current literature (past twenty years) on the discrimination and authentication of rice using different analytical techniques coupled with multivariate analysis. In recent literature, IRMS and ICPMS provide effective information for geographical identification, cultivar discrimination as well as authenticity regarding farming methods (organic vs conventional) of rice samples. Similarly, spectroscopic methods showed great potential regarding cultivar discrimination and organic rice authenticity. DNA-based methods provide valuable insights in detecting adulteration and cultivar discrimination while omic analysis was very effective in detecting adulterants from rice samples. Regarding multivariate analysis, PCA and HCA, the most common unsupervised methods used to visualize and reduce large data matrices into fewer variables before data processing. In addition, ANN, KNN, LDA, PLS-DA, SIMCA, and SVM were the most common supervised techniques which were performed to process the data obtained from different analytical techniques for rice authentication.

AB Simple Summary Precision animal husbandry based on computer vision has developed promptly, especially in poultry farming. It is believed to improve animal welfare. To achieve the precise target detection and segmentation of geese, which can improve data acquisition, we newly built the world's first goose instance segmentation dataset. Moreover, a high-precision detection and segmentation model was constructed, and the final mAP@0.5 of both target detection and segmentation reached 0.963. The evaluation of the model showed that the automated detection method proposed in this paper is feasible in a complex environment and can serve as a reference for the relevant development of the industry. With the rapid development of computer vision, the application of computer vision to precision farming in animal husbandry is currently a hot research topic. Due to the scale of goose breeding continuing to expand, there are higher requirements for the efficiency of goose farming. To achieve precision animal husbandry and to avoid human influence on breeding, real-time automated monitoring methods have been used in this area. To be specific, on the basis of instance segmentation, the activities of individual geese are accurately detected, counted, and analyzed, which is effective for achieving traceability of the condition of the flock and reducing breeding costs. We trained QueryPNet, an advanced model, which could effectively perform segmentation and extraction of geese flock. Meanwhile, we proposed a novel neck module that improved the feature pyramid structure, making feature fusion more effective for both target detection and instance individual segmentation. At the same time, the number of model parameters was reduced by a rational design. This solution was tested on 639 datasets collected and labeled on specially created free-range goose farms. With the occlusion of vegetation and litters, the accuracies of the target detection and instance segmentation reached 0.963 (mAP@0.5) and 0.963 (mAP@0.5), respectively.

TI The need for reference machines when energy labelling electric household

SO ENERGY EFFICIENCY
LA English
DT Article
DE Performance; Home appliance; Testing; Energy policy; Energy efficiency;
   Europe
AB There are over 80 countries in the world that currently use some kind of energy label for electric household appliances. In Europe, as an example, a lot of appliances are obliged to have an energy label when shown for sale, including online. Energy labels give relevant information to the consumers to help them make an environmentally beneficial choice when buying a new appliance. However, the desire for an energy efficient appliance does not outweigh the wish for good performance. Therefore, some energy labels provide information about the performance of the appliance based on international performance measurement standards (hereafter: "international standards"). Indeed, within the one appliance, increased performance can often mean increased energy consumption, so a balance between these parameters needs to be made by product designers and users. Unlike measurements that are traceable to Systeme Internationale units through metrological traceability chains, there is no natural reference data for performance measurements. Therefore, some international standards use a reference machine to relate their testing results to. The comparison of test and reference machine eliminates variances, for example, due to the auxiliary materials used and the influence of manual preparation or assessment methods. Three international standards that are currently using reference machines are examined closely in this paper. It is assessed how the reference machines and their testing results are treated, whether the reference machines are comparable with their corresponding test machines and if the use of a reference machine can be considered beneficial for the testing procedure. Additionally, three key questions are developed that will indicate whether 13 other international standards for electric household appliances could also benefit from using a reference machine. The paper concludes with six recommendations for standardisation groups and energy policymakers that will help with deciding whether a reference machine should be implemented.

AB The olive (Olea europaea L.) is one of the most ancient cultivated fruit trees. Olive trees are considered to be one of the most widely grown fruit crops in the countries of the Mediterranean basin. Olive products, such as olive oil, table olives and olive pastes are staple foods of the Mediterranean diet due to their benefits for human health, as well as other applications such as in cosmetics.
   More than 2600 olive plant cultivars have been described using morphological analysis, although many of them might be synonyms, homonyms, ecotypes or the result of crosses between neighbouring olive cultivars. The high number of olive cultivars causes a considerable problem in germplasm collection management and both the traceability and authenticity of olive oils produced, once there is an uncertainty about its correct olive cultivar denomination. Until recent years, cultivar identification was only based on morphological and agronomic traits. However, recognition of olive cultivars based on phenotypic characters was revealed to be problematic, especially in the early stages of tree development. In recent years molecular markers have been applied in olive germplasm to identify cultivars and to determine the relationships between cultivars.
   The increasing openness of genetic markers in olive trees allows detailed studies and evaluations of genetic diversity. This will provide a view of what has been attained and what still needs to be done in order to better understand this crop that has lived for centuries and still remains to be fully discovered and understood.
   Although current breeding strategies can now benefit from the availability of new polymorphic genetic markers, the characterization of olive germplasm is still far from complete. A wider gene characterization of loci related to the quality of plant products and adaptive mechanisms could provide new information and tools to support Marker Assisted Selection (MAS) strategies and new biotechnological approaches to develop suitable growing techniques and increase productivity and product quality of this species which is unique in its kind.

AB The seasonal variation of the fatty acids composition of butters were investigated over three seasons during a 12-month study in the protected designation of origin Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese area. Fatty acids were analyzed by GC-FID, and then computed by artificial neural networks (ANN). Compared with spring and winter, butter manufactured from summer milk creams showed an optimal saturated/unsaturated fatty acids ratio (-8.89 and -5.79%), lower levels of saturated fatty acids (-2.63 and -1.68%) and higher levels of mono-unsaturated (+5.50 and +3.45%), poly-unsaturated fatty acids (+0.65 and +0.17%), and rumenic acid (+0.55 and +3.41%), while vaccenic acid had lower levels in spring and higher in winter (-2.94 and +2.91%). Moreover, the ANN models were able to predict the season of production of milk creams, and classify butters obtained from spring and summer milk creams on the basis of the type of feeding regimens.
   Practical applications: The investigation on variables that affect the milk fatty acids composition can improve the quality of milk across all systems, and the combination of chromatographic and computational techniques will ensure a secure traceability enabling producers to characterize dairy products.

AB A molecular approach (DNA barcoding and phylogenetic analysis) using mitochondrial COI and 16SrRNA genes was used to identify species in crocodile dried food products (meat and feet) and skin sold on the Chinese market and generically labelled as ???? (crocodiles). All the 80 collected samples (100%) were identified at species level and five of them were also identified at sub-species level using the COI gene. Limits of the DNA barcoding approach related to the presence of sequences from misidentified specimens on official genetic databases (Genbank and BOLD) were encountered. The only DNA barcoding method was successfully applied for the species identification of 47 (58.7%) samples (42 using the COI and 5 using the 16SrRNA) while the support of the phylogenetic analysis was considered in 7 (8.7%) samples (performed using the 16SrRNA gene). For the remaining 26 samples (43.3%) the species identification was only achieved by phylogenetic analysis using the COI gene. Three species were overall detected: Crocodiles siamensis (n = 44; 55%), C. porosus (n = 29; 36.2%) and Caiman crocodilus (n = 7; 8.7%) with the sub-species C. crocodylus crocodylus in 5 out of the 7 cases. Although the traceability system of these products in China presented evident shortcomings, outcomes from this study appeared comforting since all the three species are among the most reared for meat production and can plausibly feed the market requests. Interestingly, only one of these species is included among those considered by the new EU legislation on reptile meat. Therefore, although Chinese crocodilian-based products are still not allowed to be imported in the EU market, a future law up-dating could not be excluded considering the relevance of the Chinese exports for the EU. Outcomes from this study, other than allowing to monitor products through the whole food value chain, contribute to enrich the scientific pool of data from which EU food imports legislation draw upon.

AB Near infrared reflectance spectroscopy was used to discriminate different species of freshwater fish samples. Samples from seven freshwater fish species of the family Cyprinidae (black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus), grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus), silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), bighead carp (Aristichthys nobilis), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), crucian (Carassius auratus), and bream (Parabramis pekinensis)) were scanned by near infrared reflectance spectroscopy from 1000 nm to 1799 nm. Linear discriminant analysis models were built for the classification of species. We inspected the effect of partial least square, principal component analysis, competitive adaptive reweighted sampling, and fast Fourier transform on linear discriminant analysis. The results showed that the dimension reduction methods worked very well for this example. Linear discriminant analysis models which were combined with principal component analysis and fast Fourier transform could classify accurately all the samples under multiplicative scatter correction pre-processing. According to the loadings in principal component analysis, spectra wavelengths 1000, 1001, 1154, 1208, 1284, 1288, 1497, 1665, and 1770 nm were selected as effective wavelengths in linear discriminant analysis. The discriminant analysis was simplified by using effective wavelengths as independent variables in a linear discriminant analysis model. This study indicated that linear discriminant analysis combined with near infrared reflectance spectroscopy could be an effective strategy for the classification of freshwater fish species.

AB Use of electronic identification (e-ID) of caprine breeding stock, based on radio frequency passive transponders, is compulsory in most EU countries and it is foreseen as a powerful tool for the improvement of the goat industry. This paper compares the performances of the most used e-ID devices (i.e., ear tags, injects, boluses and leg tags) with plastic ear tags in goats. Ear dimensions, environment and ear tag features result in variable retention and readability of visual and e-ID ear tags in goats. Light and high quality button ear tags provide suitable results under intensive conditions but they are not fully satisfactory under extensive conditions. Injectable transponders have been also evaluated in different body sites (ear base, armpit, groin, tail, pastern and intraperitoneal) of goats. Main drawbacks of injects are migration and retrieval at slaughter, but injection in the armpit is suitable for goats under harsh conditions (i.e., game and feral goats) and carcass traceability. Injection in the pastern has the advantage of not letting carcass residues, although readability is compromised by the small size of the transponders used and is not recommended for most on-farm applications. Performances of e-ID rumen boluses vary by bolus features and goat breed. Research showed that denser boluses than in sheep (>3.3) and high quality transponders allow >98% readability in goats. Leg tags are only recommended for adult dairy goats under intensive conditions. Dynamic reading efficiency strongly depends on the position of the antenna and on the type of e-ID device, which becomes an issue of major relevance when different e-ID device types are in use in the same herd for management and performance recording.

AB The food packaging sector has experienced much development since its inception. In the past few decades, innovations in packaging sector have led to the development of smart packaging (SP) systems that carve a niche in a highly competitive food industry. SP systems have great potential for improving the shelf-life, and safety of food products apart from their basic roles of protecting the products against unwanted biological, chemical, and physical damage and keeping them clean. Indicators and sensors, SP components, are used for real-time monitoring of meat quality and subsequently inform the retailers and consumers about the freshness, microbiological, temperature, and shelf life status of the products. Barcodes and radio-frequency identification tags are employed in meat packaging for real-time information about the authenticity, and traceability of the products in the supply chain. Recently, innovations in SP technologies resulted in fast, sensitive, and effective detection, sensing, and record keeping of freshness, microbiological, and shelf life status of meat and meat products. The SP system shows promise for extensive utilization in the meat industry in response to the consumer appreciation for safe, and quality meat products, as well as their waste reduction notions. This paper gives an updated overview of ongoing scientific research, and recent technological advances that offer the perspectives of developing smart meat packaging systems that are capable of monitoring the physical, microbial, and chemical changes of the package contents from producer to the point of sale and even beyond, and remediating potential adverse reactions.

TI The work of pig and poultry farmers: a large diversity of strategies,
   expectations, durations and productivity
SO INRA PRODUCTIONS ANIMALES
LA French
DT Article
AB Pig and poultry productions are often perceived as "industrial" since animals are kept indoors and the production rhythms are regular. This perception leads to the image of a work organization and duration that follows a similar schedule being consistent between farms. However, studies on the labor in those productions show a wide range of expectations, strategies, durations and work efficiency in relation with structural changes of the sector. In pig production, farm size increases, the use of hired labor also, and small farms disappear, in particular those with sows. In poultry production, the size increase is moderate, the alternative productions are common and farms are less specialized. Those evolutions are compared to European pig production. From an economical point of view all the strategies can be effective, the one reducing the charges, the other maximizing output per worker. At the farm scale, the studies show a large variability of working time between farms in the two type of productions, which is mainly due to facilities and equipment, mechanization, the kind of species bred, batch number but also the role given by the farmer to the unit. Inter- and intra-week work organizations in pig production differ with the batch farrowing system and breeding practices. Finally, job content is changing: development of managerial skills, reduction of exhaustive tasks replaced by supervising tasks, data management and traceability monitoring. To conclude we illustrate the effect of a change in the production system on content, duration, organization and tiredness of the farmer's work.

AB Horticultural production for the export market has been credited for rural community growth and employment in Sub-Saharan Africa. To make the agri-enterprises competitive and profitable, smallholder farmers are now required to invest in food safety and production standards such as GLOBAL Good Agricultural Practices (GLOBAL GAP). Most often, the inability to afford capital has affected compliance with food safety production standards. However, farmers can use household assets to finance the agri enterprise ventures. The purpose of the study is to explore the impact of household wealth on the adoption of food safety certification standards. The study used cross-sectional data collected from 479 smallholder farmers in Kenya. The findings reveal that 49% of the households are categorized as wealthy and 51% as poorly endowed. The empirical findings on the willingness to adopt GLOBAL GAP certification reveal that membership to GLOBAL GAP affiliated farmers groups significantly influence on wealthier farmers to attain GLOBAL GAP certification status. Farmers groups facilitate joint investments that reduce the cost of investing in GLOBAL GAP assets such as grading shed, protective gear, shower rooms, disposal pits, incinerators, hessian coolers, packaging crates, soil testing kits and establishing food traceability systems. In comparison to poor endowed farming households, the well-endowed farmers have a relatively significantly better wealth index, an indication that they can easily raise capital investments to finance GAP certification. Finally, we observe that selling beans to GAP certified buyers significantly enables farmers to comply with the expected certified production standards.

AB Ammonia and nitrite levels caused by shrimp excreta and metabolic waste and organic detritus are important limiting factors in intensive aquaculture system, the purpose of this study was to determine how ammonia and nitrite accumulation caused by accumulated these compounds affected survival and growth performance of white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. Unconsumed feed, feces and seawater in treatment group were not removed or replaced over a 33-day period, while unconsumed feed and feces in control group were removed with a siphon tube and 60 % seawater was replaced once-daily. Significantly higher ammonia and nitrite concentrations were accumulated in the seawater of treatment group from day 6 to day 33 and from day 9 to day 33, compared with control group, respectively. Significantly lower survival rate, weight gain percentage, length gain percentage and specific growth rate were recorded in treatment shrimp, compared with control shrimp. Significantly higher lipase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities, malondialdehyde content, relative expression of 4E-binding protein 1, p70S6 kinase, glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase mRNA were detected in the hepatopancreas of treatment versus control shrimp. Significantly lower protease, glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase activities, and glutathione content were detected in the hepatopancreas of treatment versus control shrimp. Meanwhile, hepatopancreas in treatment shrimp showed disorganized tubules, blurred boundaries, decreased or disappeared B, R and E cells, injured connective tissue between liver tubule, infiltrated hemocytes, narrowed lumen, and vacuolization compared with control shrimp. These findings might indicate that ammonia and nitrite accumulation caused by accumulated waste in aquaculture tanks could significantly reduce survival, growth performance of L. vannamei with hepatopancreas damage, which was resulted from accumulated reactive oxygen species. Therefore, ammonia and nitrite accumulation may significantly impact shrimp production in intensive aquaculture system.

AB China's pork industry has been dramatically changing in the last few years. Pork imports are increasing, and small-scale farms are being consolidated into large-scale multi-site facilities. These industry changes increase the need for traceability and science-based decisions around disease monitoring, surveillance, risk mitigation, and outbreak response. This study evaluated the network structure and dynamics of a typical large-scale multi-site swine facility in China, as well as the implications for disease spread using network-based metrics. Forward reachability paths were used to demonstrate the extent of epidemic spread under variable site and temporal disease introductions. Swine movements were found to be seasonal, with more movements at the beginning of the year, and fewer movements of larger pigs later in the year. The network was highly egocentric, with those farms within the evaluated production system demonstrating high connectivity. Those farms which would contribute the highest epidemic potential were identified. Among these, different farms contributed to higher expected epidemic spread at different times of the year. Using these approaches, increased availability of swine movement networks in China could help to identify priority locations for surveillance and risk mitigation for both endemic problems and transboundary diseases such as the recently introduced, and rapidly spreading, African swine fever virus.

AB The application of the Internet of Things in agricultural development usually occurs via a monitoring network that consists of a large number of sensor nodes, thus gradually transforming agriculture from a human-oriented and single-machine-centric production model to an information- and software-centric production model. Due to the large area coverage of agriculture and the variety of production objects, if all farmland perception information is gathered into the cloud server, the server will exert greater pressure on the network, which reduces the speed of response to event processing. This problem may be perfectly solved by the recent emergence of Edge computing, which can share the load of the cloud server and reduce the delay. Edge computing has prospects in agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. The application of the Agricultural Internet of Things integrates artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and blockchain and Virtual/Augmented Reality technologies. This paper primarily reviews the application of Edge computing in the Agricultural Internet of Things and investigates the combination of Edge computing and Artificial Intelligence, blockchain and Virtual/Augmented reality technology. The challenges of Edge computing task allocation, data processing, privacy protection and security, and service stability in agriculture are reviewed. The future development direction of Edge computing in the Agricultural Internet of Things is predicted.

AB A need exists for a reliable method to determine the geographical and botanical origin of hops. For this study, three sets of samples were collected: the first set comprised 5 German samples; the second set comprised samples of hops from 10 of the world's major hop-growing regions; and the third comprised the 4 main Slovenian regions. The samples were analyzed using isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) to obtain delta C-13, delta N-15, and delta S-34 values. The delta N-15 (2.2 parts per thousand to 8.4 parts per thousand) and delta S-34 (0.7 parts per thousand to 12.3 parts per thousand) values were the most discriminating parameters for classifying hop according to geographical origin. ANOVA showed distinct groupings for 8 out of the 10 hop-growing regions. Although it was not possible to distinguish the geographical origin of hops based on delta C-13 (-28.9 parts per thousand to 24.7 parts per thousand), in the case of botanical origin, delta C-13 values proved to be the most discriminative albeit with limited success.

AB In animal sciences, the number of published meta-analyses is increasing at a rate of 15% per year. This current review focuses on the good practices and the potential pitfalls in the conduct of meta-analyses in animal sciences, nutrition in particular. Once the study objectives have been defined, several key phases must be considered when doing a meta-analysis. First, as a principle of traceability, criteria used to select or discard publications should be clearly stated in a way that one could reproduce the final selection of data. Then, the coding phase, aiming to isolate specific experimental factors for an accurate graphical and statistical interpretation of the database, is discussed. Following this step, the study of the levels of independence of factors and of the degree of data balance of the meta-design represents an essential phase to ensure the validity of statistical processing. The consideration of the study effect as fixed or random must next be considered. It appears based on several examples that this choice does not generally have any influence on the conclusions of a meta-analysis when the number of experiments is sufficient.

AB Mozzarella di Bufala Campana (MBC) is a PDO cheese produced from whole buffalo milk in specific regions of southern Italy. Due to the high price and the limited amount of buffalo milk, MBC is potentially subject to mislabelling. Stable isotope ratio analysis combined with elemental analysis is one powerful technique for detecting the authenticity of PDO cheeses. Here, the elemental and isotopic profiles of authentic samples of buffalo milk and the corresponding MBC samples collected in the reference area in winter and summer are presented in an initial exploratory study. By merging MBC-PDO samples with non-PDO samples of buffalo mozzarella produced both inside and outside the reference area, a model was developed to classify product categories for this cheese. Despite the differences occurring during processing, along with differences in the season and production area, the model was effective in distinguishing PDO and non-PDO mozzarella, particularly when non-PDO cheeses were made outside the MBC reference area.

AB Consumer surveys were conducted in the Western, Central, and Eastern regions of Venezuela to determine buying expectations, motivations, needs, perceptions, and preferences of beef consumers, and their acceptance of domestic (and foreign) beef, as affected by different intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Data (n = 693) were gathered by face-to-face interviews on the way out of fresh markets, butcher stores, supermarkets, and, in some cases, at home by using a 45-question structured questionnaire. Responses were subjected to factorial analysis of correspondence (FA) and hierarchical cluster analysis. From the FA, the first two factors explain 74% of the common variance. Factor 1 comprises intrinsic attributes such as color, smell, tenderness, flavor, juiciness, and freshness; while Factor 2 contains extrinsic attributes, mostly related to the origin. The FA profiling data showed that it is possible to concentrate on the traits that consumers usually use as a criterion to perceive beef quality, and to purchase beef. Using cluster analysis, four groups of consumers were mainly distinguished by region, intrinsic attributes, and credence attributes related to production system, aging, traceability, and hygiene. Results from this study will be helpful in designing strategies for recovering and enhancing the future, domestic beef demand.

AB Simple Summary The ability to identify individual animals has gained great interest in beef feedlots to allow for animal tracking and all applications for precision management of individuals. This study assessed the feasibility and performance of a total of 59 deep learning models in identifying individual cattle with muzzle images. The best identification accuracy was 98.7%, and the fastest processing speed was 28.3 ms/image. A dataset containing 268 US feedlot cattle and 4923 muzzle images was published along with this article. This study demonstrates the great potential of using deep learning techniques to identify individual cattle using muzzle images and to support precision beef cattle management. Individual feedlot beef cattle identification represents a critical component in cattle traceability in the supply food chain. It also provides insights into tracking disease trajectories, ascertaining ownership, and managing cattle production and distribution. Animal biometric solutions, e.g., identifying cattle muzzle patterns (unique features comparable to human fingerprints), may offer noninvasive and unique methods for cattle identification and tracking, but need validation with advancement in machine learning modeling. The objectives of this research were to (1) collect and publish a high-quality dataset for beef cattle muzzle images, and (2) evaluate and benchmark the performance of recognizing individual beef cattle with a variety of deep learning models. A total of 4923 muzzle images for 268 US feedlot finishing cattle (>12 images per animal on average) were taken with a mirrorless digital camera and processed to form the dataset. A total of 59 deep learning image classification models were comparatively evaluated for identifying individual cattle. The best accuracy for identifying the 268 cattle was 98.7%, and the fastest processing speed was 28.3 ms/image. Weighted cross-entropy loss function and data augmentation can increase the identification accuracy of individual cattle with fewer muzzle images for model development. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the great potential of deep learning applications for individual cattle identification and is favorable for precision livestock management. Scholars are encouraged to utilize the published dataset to develop better models tailored for the beef cattle industry.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a multi-analytical approach for origin authentication of cocoa bean shells (CBS). The overall chemical profiles of CBS from different origins were characterized using diffuse reflectance near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and attenuated total reflectance mid-infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FT-IR) for molecular composition identification, as well as inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) for elemental composition identification. Exploratory chemometric techniques based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were applied to each single technique for the identification of systematic patterns related to the geographical origin of samples. A combination of the three techniques proved to be the most promising approach to establish classification models. Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis modelling of fused PCA scores of three independent models was used and compared with single technique models. Improved classification of CBS samples was obtained using the fused model. Satisfactory classification rates were obtained for Central African samples with an accuracy of 0.84.

AB Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) has attracted much attention in the detection of genetic signatures of cancer present at low levels in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in blood. A growing number of laboratory-developed liquid biopsy tests based on such technology have become commercially available for clinical settings. To obtain consistent and comparable results, an international standard is necessary for validation of the analytical performance. In this study, a novel and SI-traceable "ctDNA" reference material (RM) carrying BRAF V600E was prepared by gravimetrically mixing a 152 bp PCR amplicon and sonicated wild-type genomic DNA. The ddPCR performance was evaluated by analyzing serial "ctDNA" dilutions using a competitive MGB assay. The mutant frequency concordance (k) between ddPCR and the gravimetrical value was 1.03 in the range from 53.9% to 0.1%. The limit of blank (LoB), detection (LoD) and quantification (LoQ) of ddPCR assay were determined to be 0.01%, 0.02% and 0.1%, respectively. Results from the interlaboratory study, using challenging low levels of BRAF V600E ctDNA RMs, demonstrated that the participating laboratories had the appropriate technical competency to perform accurate ddPCR-based low level of ratio measurements. However, a systematic error caused by uncorrected droplet volume in Naica Crystal ddPCR platform was found by using the ctDNA RM. Between-laboratory consistency in copy number measurement was greatly improved when a correct droplet volume was applied for the ddPCR measurement by using the ctDNA RM. This confirms that the "ctDNA" RM is fit for the validation of ddPCR systems for ctDNA quantification. This would also support translation of tests for circulating tumor DNA by ddPCR into routine use.

AB To reduce environmental burdens from the food system, a shift towards environmentally sustainable diets is needed. In this study, the environmental impacts of the Swedish diet were benchmarked relative to global environmental boundaries suggested by the EAT-Lancet Commission. To identify local environmental concerns not captured by the global boundaries, relationships between the global EAT-Lancet variables and the national Swedish Environmental Objectives (SEOs) were analysed and additional indicators for missing aspects were identified. The results showed that the environmental impacts caused by the average Swedish diet exceeded the global boundaries for greenhouse gas emissions, cropland use and application of nutrients by two- to more than four-fold when the boundaries were scaled to per capita level. With regard to biodiversity, the impacts caused by the Swedish diet transgressed the boundary by six-fold. For freshwater use, the diet performed well within the boundary. Comparison of global and local indicators revealed that the EAT-Lancet variables covered many aspects included in the SEOs, but that these global indicators are not always of sufficiently fine resolution to capture local aspects of environmental sustainability, such as eutrophication impacts. To consider aspects and impact categories included in the SEO but not currently covered by the EAT-Lancet variables, such as chemical pollution and acidification, additional indicators and boundaries are needed. This requires better inventory data on e.g., pesticide use and improved traceability for imported foods.

AB Background: Ethiopia set an ambitious masterplan to increase chicken meat and egg production from 2015 to 2020. Poultry breeding, multiplication and distribution centers in the country have received executive order to import, amplify and distribute commercial chickens to end users. The biosecurity and the pathogen fauna of the centers have not been evaluated as to whether the centers could implement the mission effectively without any risk. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the biosecurity practices and the pathogen prevalence, risk factors and their antimicrobial resistance (AMR) using Salmonella as case study.
   Methods: Routine farm workers of the centers were interviewed about the different management (biosecurity) practices using a checklist. Samples (n = 270) from different sources consisting of chicken's cloacal swab (n = 244), personnel hand swab (n = 9) and bedding (n = 17) were collected from three chicken multiplication centers. Standard bacteriological methods were used for the isolation of Salmonella. Disk diffusion method was used for drug sensitivity testing.
   Results: Antimicrobials were often over prescribed without confirming the cause of ill health and without susceptibility testing. The general biosecurity and flock management practices were substandard. Salmonella was isolated from 45 (16.7%) of the 270 samples. Its prevalence was significantly (p<0.05) associated with location of the multiplication center, 27% at Bonga and 10.6% at Hawassa. Sample type was also significantly (p<0.05) affected in that it was higher in the bedding (35.3%) and personnel hand swabs (33.3%) than in the chicken cloaca (14.8%), which demonstrates the poor biosecurity and personnel hygienic practices in the centers. All of the 45 isolates (100%) exhibited resistance to kanamycin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, nalidixic acid (97.8%), ampicillin (97.8%), cefoxitin (97.8%), streptomycin (97.8%) tetracycline (97.8%), chloramphenicol (91.3%), ciprofloxacin (31.1%), and gentamicin (0%). Alarmingly, 42 isolates (93.4%) exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR) to >= 8 drugs and all 45 isolates had resistance to >= 3 drugs. The high rate of Salmonella isolation from (i) bedding, (ii) personnel hand swabs (iii) chickens, (iv) presence of more MDR isolates, (v) coupled with poor biosecurity practices in the centers could pose a risk for spreading of pathogens and drug resistant genes to the smallholder chicken producers and the public.
   Conclusions: We conclude that the poultry breeding, multiplication and distribution centers in Ethiopia, as they stand currently, seem to be a source of pathogens and AMR isolates at least for Salmonella. Therefore, strict biosecurity, personnel safety, prudent drug use, regular monitoring and traceability of Salmonella serotypes or genotypes and AMR are recommended.

AB Background: To improve agricultural practices and the food/feed security, plant breeding techniques were developed, including transgenesis commonly using Agrobacterium tumefaciens or biolistic technologies. To guarantee the traceability of GMO in food/feed chain and the consumer's freedom of choice, regulatory frameworks were established in many countries around the world, such as in Europe. Their implementations, including detection systems usually based on qPCR, are becoming complex and expensive regarding the number of analysis to perform. Moreover, the dispersion of publicly available information about developed GMO prevents to accurately estimate the efficiency of the standard detection system applied to unauthorized GMO.
   Scope and approach: To illustrate this problem, the case of rice, one of the leading staple crops, was investigated. An overview of worldwide developed biotech rice generated by transgenesis was thus conducted, based on 1067 peer-reviewed publications, and analysed regarding inter alia their expressed genes of interest and the corresponding traits, their transformation processes and the elements composing their transgenic cassettes. From this work, the power and weakness of the standard detection system, notably used by the European enforcement laboratories, are evaluated. To strengthen this system, especially with unauthorized GMO, additional strategies are suggested. Moreover, given the growing interest for biotech rice produced by new plant breeding techniques, related challenges for their detection are discussed.
   Key findings and conclusions: According to all collected information, suitable detection strategies, combining qPCR to additional technologies (e.g., DNA walking and NGS), are proposed to cover most of inventoried biotech rice. The present approach, including the data centralization to subsequently suggest appropriated detection strategies, can be extended to biotech events from different species. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) is protected by Geographical Indications as harvested roots have different regional characteristics. The aim of this study was to distinguish 95 American ginseng samples from four origins (including America, Canada, Shandong province and the Northeast provinces in China), and to further discriminate samples harvested within the protected designation of origin (PDO) from those harvested in non-PDO regions. Two metabolomic methods were used to acquire qualitative data on the metabolites of American ginseng samples from different origins, namely high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and headspace-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-GC-MS). There were significant differences in numerous metabolites, including volatile compounds and ginsenosides. American ginsengs from four different regions were discriminated based on 25 volatile compounds and 8 ginsenosides using linear discriminant analysis (LDA), which had a 96.8% accuracy and a 74.7% cross validation rate, and random forest (RF) modeling, which reached 100% accuracy using the training set and 92.9% accuracy using the testing set. The same 33 analytes combined with LDA and RF were compared for discrimination of PDO and non-PDO samples. The 100% accuracy was again obtained using the RF model, but only when using data from both HS-GC-MS and HPLC. The result showed that chemical composition combined with chemometric is effectively and accurately to study the origins of American ginseng.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Milk is an important food item in the diet of Kenyans, especially infants. During the last two decades, the dairy sector in Kenya has witnessed important growth in production and improvements in milk quality. The informal marketing channel still prevails, and the Kenya Dairy Board, the regulator of the dairy sector, is currently introducing new regulations to increase registration and licensing of smallholder producers and dairy business operators, improve product hygiene and quality, and safeguard the health of consumers. These new regulations encompass, among others, the requirement to pasteurize milk before it is sold and adopt traceability processes and quality tests; most of these will probably result in higher milk prices at retail level. Using the best-worst scaling approach in this study, we analyzed the potential effects of milk price increase on household milk purchase and allocation to infants (6-48 months of age). The results indicate that an increase in milk price will decrease milk allocation to and intake by children. Households will replace the lost infant milk intake by fruits or porridge that might not be of equivalent nutritional value to milk. Any reforms to policies and regulatory systems aimed at streamlining the dairy sector should account for impacts on milk prices, responsiveness of consumers to price variations and infant nutrition. We recommend that regulatory and development agencies consider interventions that do not increase price for consumers and facilitate access to affordable and safe milk for children and entire households.

AB Mixing ratio of ambient ammonia (NH3) was measured at various locations of the National Capital Region (NCR) of Delhi, India using a NH3-analyzer during January 2010 to June 2012 in campaign mode. The present study has been carried out on campaign based measurement of mixing ratios of NH3 and NO (x) for short period of time over the NCR of Delhi represent the indicative values over the region. The average mixing ratio of ambient NH3 was 20.9 +/- A 1.6 ppb during the period. The maximum average mixing ratio of ambient NH3 (28.8 +/- A 3.0 ppb) was recorded in an industrial area surrounded by intensive vehicular traffic followed by an agricultural farm (27.5 +/- A 2.1 ppb), whereas the minimum (6.4 +/- A 1.2 ppb) was recorded in the semi-urban area. The diurnal trend of NH3 depended on the ambient temperature at most of the sites and was affected by wind direction. Ambient NH3 was correlated with the NO (x) mixing ratio suggesting that the vehicular emission may be one of the sources of ambient NH3 in the NCR of Delhi. However, long-term measurements of ambient NH3 and their precursors will lead to seasonal variation of source apportionment over the NCR, Delhi, India.

AB Conventional drug delivery systems contain substantial amounts of excipients such as polymers and lipids, typically with low drug loading capacity and lack of intrinsic traceability and multifunctionality. Here, we report fully active pharmaceutical ingredient nanoparticles (FAPIN) which were self-assembled by minimal materials, but seamlessly orchestrated versatile theranostic functionalities including: i) self delivery: no additional carriers were required, all components in the formulation are active pharmaceutical ingredients; ii) self-indicating: no additional imaging tags were needed. The nanoparticle itself was composed of 100% imaging agents, so that the stability, drug release, subcellular dispositions, biodistribution and therapeutic efficacy of FAPINs can be readily visualized by ample imaging capacities, including energy transfer relay dominated, dual-color fluorogenic property, near-infrared fluorescence imaging and magnetic resonance imaging; and iii) highly effective trimodality cancer therapy, encompassing photodynamic-, photothermal- and chemo-therapies. FAPIN5 were fabricated with very simple material (a photosensitizer-drug conjugate), unusually achieved similar to 10 times better in vitro antitumor activity than their free counterparts, and were remarkably efficacious in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) glioblastoma multiforme animal models. Only two doses of FAPIN5 enabled complete ablation of highly malignant PDX tumors in 50% of the mice. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
